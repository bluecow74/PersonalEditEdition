TEXT_TOOLTIP_DREDNAR,After a boring career on a merchant ship, Drednar joined Karn Granzor when the pirate boarded his freighter. Drednar learned combat and command from Granzor, but he was not alone in resenting the captain's hoarded loot and lack of style. He and several other mutineers took the chance to depart, acquire their own vessel, and defeat Granzor. Drednar went on to become a successful and colorful freebooter based on Taraloon, refusing a cybernetic eye in favor of his patch's "piratical effect". His favored tactic for finding prey was creating artificial ice asteroids in trade lanes to force ships out of hyperspace.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_KEEK,Chief of the Internal Security Police of the despotic New Regime of Brigia, Keek was a wicked Brigian who lead the swift ambush that attempted to halt the University of Rudrig's delivery of academic technology to his impoverished home planet. His mission would have succeeded, were it not for the intervention of a pair of freelance smugglers in a modified YT-1300. Treacherous by nature, he was nonetheless a poor liar when it came to dealing with off-worlders.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_KIMOGILA,A made-to-order update of an older design used during the Ithulian War, the Kimogila serves as a bomber for the fleets of the Hutts and a variety of mercenary and pirate groups. While lacking somewhat in flight performance, the rugged frame and respectable weapon loadout are considered to outweigh that downside when it comes to providing wanton slaughter on civilian targets or attack runs in fleet combat.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_KOMRK,Kom'rk Skirata was a Null Class Advanced Recon Commando who started life known as Null-6. This change in name came due to close ties with his Mandalorian trainers such as Jaing Skirata. Kom’rk specialised in espionage and interrogation with unique talent at extracting information out of people with one such highlight being the discovery of General Grievous' location. He would desert the Republic during Order 66 in order to live with his adoptive Mandalorian Clan Skirata.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_KOMRK_GUNSHIP,Coming from a Mandalorian word for Gauntlet, the Kom'r'k was used by the Mandalorians as both a fighter and transport. Despite being labelled as a fighter by its creators MandalMotors, the Kom'r'k was too large to actually be considered a fighter by the majority of people who instead classified it as an assault ship or gunship. A noticeable design feature was its wings which rotated to face upwards when landing to save horizontal space. The wings were also able to rotate 360 degrees around the main hull while the Gauntlet was in flight. While used by a variety of Mandalorian groups, it was their usage by the extremist group Death Watch which saw the most prominent usage during the Clone Wars.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_LANCER,A slow but dangerous anti-fighter escort craft. While technically introduced a mere month after the Clone Wars, the class would not see a rise in popularity until after the first Death Star was destroyed. Ilon Drez proposed using the vessel to screen vulnerable stations and larger vessels, leading to the ship being significanlty more common well into the Vong War.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_LANCER_CW,Proof of concept vessel meant to protect stations and slower assault ships from fighter swarms. While well-armed, a variety of teething issues and design flaws will see the class a failure until several decades into the future, where an upgraded version is touted as a corporate solution to a military and political problem.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_MANKVIM,A swarm-based fighter with barely noticeable shields developed by the Techno Union, the design is most recognized for its impressive speed and saw proliferation into the Corporate Sector Authority and civilian markets after the Clone Wars. It is best used to intercept enemy bombers.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_MARAUDER,Originally designed by Sienar as a patrol and escort gunship for the Judicial Forces, the design was declined for purchase by the Republic government proper. Sienar instead ended up selling the hulls to other groups, including the Corporate Sector Authority and various independent groups, where the ships often ended up in pirate hands. It is well suited for supporting other vessels against capital ships.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_MARAUDER_HULL,Hull: 850 (Corvette)
TEXT_TOOLTIP_MARAUDER_MISSILE,A refit of the Marauder-class corvette made by the Rebel Alliance after purchasing stolen Corporate Sector Marauders from smugglers. The base Marauder's laser cannons were removed and its engines downsized to accomodate concussion missile pods, in hopes to make an equivalent to the Empire's Broadside Cruiser. The result allows this Marauder variant to provide devastating missile barrages to vulnerable ships at the expense of speed and maneuverability.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_MC80_HOT_LINER,Designed by the Mon Calamari for deep space exploration and first contact with alien species, the Home One Subclass of the MC80 line was one of the largest vessels made by the Mon Calamari before the start of the Galactic Civil War. Each Liner was unique although they all shared a roughly similar basic design as the Mon Calamari would design and produce each ship as an individual rather than a production run of a single class of ship. Despite their civilian role, these liners still possessed weapons and decent protection to allow the vessel to protect itself from pirates.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_MIKA,Mika was the younger son of Popara who lived a hidden and frustrated life of a Hutt who could touch the Force but with no one to train him. He rejected his father's focus on legitimate business and created a modified strain of Glitterstim and an underground network to distribute it. With this new "Tempest" spice Mika was able to ensnare a Jedi and enthusiastically began learning the ways of the Force and the lightsaber.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_MORNINGSTAR_B,Dogfighter configuration of a tri-winged picket fighter originally produced by Kuat Systems Engineering for planetary defence, but more popular among mercenary and criminal groups for its varied capabilities. The Morningstar-B model packs additional laser cannons to deal with other fighter craft, but lacks munitions for use against other target types.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_MORNINGSTAR_C,Bomber configuration of a tri-winged picket fighter originally produced by Kuat Systems Engineering for planetary defence, but more popular among mercenary and criminal groups for its varied capabilities. The Morningstar-C model has a series of munitions modules intended for attacking enemy capital ships but is not as effective engaging other fighters as the A and B models.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_MUNIFICENT,Designed by the Intergalactic Banking Clan as a mobile communications, transport and debt-enforcement vessel. Its modular and skeletal design causes it to be fragile but easy to produce, traits which led to it becoming the backbone of the CIS fleet in the Clone Wars, and assorted usage afterwards. Has a significant amount of firepower but does not hold up when taking damage.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_MUNIFICENT_C3,Command, Control and Communications Munificent. One of many variations on the modular base design that adjusts weapon loadout to facilitate other functions, in this case more powerful sensors and comms systems compared to the already impressive base model.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_NEUTRONSTAR,A cruiser developed during the Clone Wars to serve as a second-line and garrison vessel and generally not pressed into frontline service during the conflict. The Empire did not like the design and relegated it to Outer Rim duties or sold them off to assorted groups, leading to the Rebel Alliance acquiring them. It is often modified into a starfighter carrier by stripping out cargo space but is otherwise a discount Rendili cruiser in stock form.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_NEUTRONSTAR_HULL,Hull: 1500 (Frigate)

TEXT_TOOLTIP_NIMBUS_COMMANDO,Nimbus Commandos are specialized elite infantry from Jabiim, originally drawn from nationalist leader Alto Stratus' Bronze Nimbus command and elements of the Jabiimi Army who joined him. They are practiced soldiers of Jabiim's high-precipitation environment, with their repulsorlift skates allowing any Nimbus to effortlessly move across swampy terrain in ways normal infantry cannot. Nimbus units are armed with blaster rifles capable of long to mid-range fire, and cram their suits with enough explosives that they can take on even large walkers. The power of the Nimbus would persist on Jabiim in the time of the Empire by collaborating with the new government, with some members going off to serve as freelance mercenaries.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_RIBOGA,Riboga estalished himself as the crime lord in the Cularin system several decades before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, supervising a number of unsavory practices including a slaving ring and a spice mining operation on Kemix he built a huge warship to guard. He left due to the alleged unprofitability of the remote system, though in truth he was the victim of an embezzling majordomo who took over the operation and abolished the slave trade.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_RINGNECK_RECON_DROID,The Ringneck recon droid, also known as the Separatist probe droid, was a model of probe droid manufactured by Arakyd Industries. It was used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. It came in varying sizes, one of the most feared variants which protected the Separatist stronghold on Lola Sayu.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SCURRG_H6,Heavy bomber created by the Nubian Design Collective who hoped to sell the design to Outer Rim Planetary Defense Forces. Very well armed and capable, but with a large price tag that reduced popularity among legal interests. Such interests resulted in the common addition of the topside turret compared to the original design.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SCURRG_H6_PROTOTYPE,Heavy bomber created by the Nubian Design Collective who hoped to sell the design to Outer Rim Planetary Defense Forces.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SCYK_FIGHTER,Named after a vicious Tatooine reptile, the M3-A Scyk is the first in a series of custom starfighters commissioned by the Hutt Cartels from MandalMotors. It is a lightly armored interceptor that functions well for base defense and capital escort duties. The loadout of the fighter is customizable but generally limited to a single laser cannon, making it best used in short-range strikes.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SCYK_HEAVY_FIGHTER,The M3-A Scyk was a basic fighter produced by MandalMotors for semilegitimate organizations such as the Zann Consortium or the Hutt Cartels. The Scyk was just dangerous enough to be worthwhile without drawing the attention of MandalMotors Imperial supervisors, with its cheap price and variable weapon mounts making it popular on secondary markets even after production ceased. Heavier variants of the Scyk feature marginally improved durability and slugthrower cannons paired with a concussion missile launcher.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SD_6,Large, infantry-scale battle droid produced in the final days of the Galactic Republic as an installation defense unit and fire support platform. A solid design that builds on several earlier generations and effective enough to see Republic service throughout the Clone Wars despite political outcry.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SKIPRAY_ADVANCED,Heavier Skipray model best known for its increased munitions load over earlier designs. Has otherwise equal performance and durability to the 12H model. It is best used to attack enemy capital ships but can be turned onto fighters in a pinch due to its turreted lasers.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUN_GUARD,One of the most feared mercenary units in the galaxy, originally formed by Thyrsian special forces units revolting against the Echani Command, before being subverted into a Sith Cult over the centuries. They are geared towards heavy personal combat and are very effective at engaging other infantry, fortifications and light targets but do lack for heavy anti-vehicle capabilities like the Mandalorian infantry they rival and individually surpass.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VI,An armed version of the obsolete Super Transport VI armed with makeshift concussion missile launchers attached via external modular pods. A light shield was also added to increase durability under fire. This  resulted in a vessel which was better than nothing in battle and could maybe fend off some minor pirate attacks but worse than any dedicated combat ship.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VI_CARGO,Considered severely out of date by the time of the Galactic Civil War, most of these old massive cargo ships had been replaced by newer models of the KDY Super Transport series by the time of the Battle of Endor. A handful persisted in use around the galaxy although mainly in the hands of pirates who used the large vessel as mobile staging grounds for their raids.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VI_CARGO_SHIELD,Shields: Unshielded
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VI_HULL,Hull: 600 (Corvette)
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VI_MISSILE,Super Transport VI hull loaded with torpedo stocks to serve as an often sacrificial missile boat for desperate battles or owners. Can output a respectable amount of damage but will not survive under fire.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VII,A KDY Super Transport VII Bulk Cruiser modified to be better protected against pirate raids. Laser emplacements along the hull were added to allow the transport to defend itself against fighter attacks while the addition of ion cannons allowed it to try to fend off larger attackers. Weak shielding was also added to the vessel to provide it some additional protection over its civilian grade hull.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VII_CARGO,Smaller than their predecessor, the KDY  Super Transport VII could still carry an impressive 2 million metric tons of cargo. To maximise cargo carrying capacity the base design was slow, unshielded, and unarmed making them extremely easy prey for pirates.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VII_HULL,Hull: 650 (Corvette)
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VII_INTERDICTOR,A version of the KDY Super Transport VII refitted with a single gravity well generator in its cavernous holds to create a makeshift interdictor. Such an expensive investment also warranted the addition of lasers for self defence so it was not entirely helpless.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VII_MISSILE,Standard Super Transport VII loaded with assault missiles to serve as an emergency or cheap fire support platform. While hard-hitting at range it can not expect to survive the attention of even a small proper warship with much success.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI,Seeing the adhoc armed refits of the older Super Transport models in response to pirate raids, KDY created their own armed variant of the Super Transport XI. Quad laser cannons were dotted around the hull to provide all round protection from fighter attacks that were frequently a key element in pirate attacks. The token shields of the base cargo design were also heavily reinforced to allow the ship to withstand minor attacks. This redesign turned a once helpless ponderous giant into a nasty surprise for attackers.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI_CARGO,A giant KDY freighter capable of holding 25 million metric tons of cargo, a single Super Transport XI can take the place of hundreds of freighters. However this cargo capacity was obtained through the sacrifice of shields, weapons, and engine power. Thus this lumbering beast of a transport is suitable only for the safest routes or routes with sizable escorts. Records show that on occasion enterprising individuals have been witnessed refitting the Super Transport in unexpected ways.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI_CARGO_SHIELD,Shields: Unshielded
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI_HULL,Hull: 2345 (Frigate)
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI_MISSILE,Super Transport XI filled with a variety of munitions as a cheap, makeshift missile cruiser. While the size allows space for a respectable amount of firepower that can hurt even larger ships when unmolested, focus on the vessel by strikecraft or other cruisers will quickly result in its destruction.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI_MODIFIED,KDY's Super Transports are unarmed, lightly constructed cargo containers, but have a surprisingly rich history as makeshift combat support units. After all, the cavernous bay can fit an astonishing number of fighters to someone who only lacks a base, even if it can offer them little protection.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_TAGGE,Battlecruisers commissioned by Tagge Company to defend their holdings from other corporations in a dangerous galaxy. While they are property of the House of Tagge, they were often offered to assist the Galactic Empire on missions the House saw achieving mutually beneficial results. As an early demonstration ship, they are notably outdated compared to Imperial-era vessels.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_TARGRIM,The Riders of the Maelstrom are a pirate group that terrify the Maelstrom nebula nearly unopposed, save for the Rebel privateer Rodin Higron. The Riders' leader is a massive, four-armed pirate that supplements his fearsome reputation with genetic "donations" from vile crime bosses, which makes him an unpredictable set of multiple personalities, all of which are ruthless.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TARGRIM_SQUADRON,Fighters: 10 / 20
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TARNTA,Tarnta Bane created the Consolidations Unlimited group to run a variety of criminal operations, from slaving to piracy to smuggling. Unusually for a slaver, he has a perpetually cheery disposition, always cracking jokes, caring for his men, and cheerfully wishing his victims "better luck next time". He will also kill anyone who crosses him with the same glee, as many who have underestimated his charming personality have found.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TECTOR,The battle-oriented counterpart of the Imperator-class that shares the same base hull. It was developed alongside the ISD-1 during the Clone Wars but was never as popular among the Imperial Navy. Additional armor plating and structural reinforcement cover up the reactor dome and hangar bay which lends increased durability at the cost of a fighter escort. It is well suited to battling other large vessels but requires protection from bombers.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_TEMPEST_CRUISER,An unusual combat cruiser design secretly developed by a fringe Hutt. While durable and flexible, the overall firepower was considered weak when compared to purely military contemporaries. Capable of trading fire with most target types while contributing a respectable amount of smallcraft to the fight as a result of its impressive cargo space.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_TEMPLE_SECURITY,Security forces tasked with keeping the Jedi Temple secure from threats ranging anywhere from eccentrics to armed incursions. Their ranks drew from non-Force-sensitives and former Jedi unable to pass their trials who still sought to serve the Order. Temple Security's history with the Jedi Order spanned thousands of years, before both were crushed together by Order 66. The reestablishment of the Jedi Order under Luke Skywalker prompted a renewed need for security for the New Jedi Order's temple, with a new Temple Security formed from civilian recruits.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_THALASSIAN,The Thalassians are the oldest of the major slaving groups in the Outer Rim, alongside their bitter rivals the Zygerrians and Karazaks. They operate on a large scale, covertly supplying large mass labor for corporations and new colonies, or sourcing to unscupulous Hutts. Undisciplined, savage, and feared, Thalassian slaveships enjoy piracy and mercenary work and will have few cares if half their targets are killed, or if their prey consists of other pirates, smugglers, and sometimes other Thalassians. Their convoys most often consist of a Kaloth Battlecruisers and Y164 transports.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_THETA_SHUTTLE,Built by Cygnus Spaceworks, the Theta-class T-2c shuttle is the follow-up design on an older shuttle design.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_BOMBER,A bomber armed with proton torpedoes. It replaces the unpopular TIE/gt model and is a significant improvement over that design. It is best used to attack the larger enemy ships and space stations along with bombing runs against ground targets.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_FIGHTER,A speedy and maneuverable light fighter that became one of the most recognizable Imperial symbol after being chosen to standardize fighter models shortly after the Empire's founding. It is cheap and lacks shielding and adequate armor compared to other designs. It is best used en-masse to engage enemy fighters and bombers.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_POD,Spinoff design of the T.I.E. Starfighter line pushed into service during the last year of the Clone Wars. Overgunned but under-protected compared to the base design, the near-exclusive use of cloned pilots betrays their expendabiliy in the name of enemies killed.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_STARFIGHTER,An upgrade of the Republic's T.I.E Starfighter, the TIE Starfighter was the first member of the TIE family designed in the Imperial era. The Empire needed vast numbers of fighters to occupy an entire galaxy, so the TIE Starfighter was quickly phased out in favor of the less capable and less expensive TIE/ln (better known as the TIE Fighter).
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TNT,Originally a mining vehicle designed for the spice mines of Kessel during the era of the Republic, the Treaded Neutron Torch was adapted into military usage during the collapse of the Galactic Empire as makeshift assault tanks. A hull designed to survive perilous mine shafts offers a surprising amount of protection in combat and torches capable of melting easily through rock are also capable of burning their way through lots of other material that might see use on a battlefield.

Banquets, shooting displays and more take place at these events, but the highlight is the Krayt dragons kept belowdecks being fed former business associates.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TOSCAN_BOMBER,Use of the Toscan Q-8 kit's available heavy weapon and internal capacity capabilities is capable of producing a bomber model inferior to the later Y-wings it resembles.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TOSCAN_GUNSHIP,Variation of the Toscan platform used produced by Sienar to testbed systems for the Skipray blatboat that were not present on the more CAS-oriented Turbostorm forebearer. The up-gunned vessel with a large complement of weapons paired with the resilient frame results in a medium-heavy fighter dangerous beyond the design projections.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TOSCAN_INTERCEPTOR,Pirate and privateer conversion of the Shobquix Toscan starfighter kit. Aggressively tuned power systems provide the base for modified engines and laser cannons that assist in running down targets compared to the stock model.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TOSCAN_MISSILE,Open-frame starfighter kit designed by Shobquix Yards that initially floundered before becoming popular throughout the galaxy. While servicable in general performance the cost to produce legally was considered overly high. This common configuration includes a concussion missile launcher.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_V_WING,An extremely fast interceptor with a respectable armament. Developed by Walex Blissex during the Clone Wars to be launched in swarms by mainline Republic carriers, it would later be phased out after a few years of Imperial service in favour of the more cost-effective TIE series. It is best used to engage enemy fighters or respond to incoming bombers.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_V_WING_BOMBER,Rare variant of the V-wing interceptor that adds bomber level armaments to its frame.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_VAAT,The Variable Altitude Assault Transport/enforcement was a Rothana Heavy Engineering gunship transport design which predates the LAAT. It lacks the firepower of its successor design but provides a lot more protection to its occupants and is more resilient to incoming fire. It was seen in service in a range of local security forces including those based on Coruscant before the Clone Wars and would remain in service with law enforcement agencies even into the Galactic Civil War.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_VANGAR,Vangar is a dreaded Barabel pirate lord based on Prexiar. His enemies are treated cruelly and failures and traitors among his own crew fare scarcely better against his short temper. For all his use in combat situations, Vangar is carefully managed by a group of "advisors" who ensure the subtler aspects of piracy are not hampered by their fearsome leader.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_VEILED_QUEEN,The Veiled Sorority is a secretive pirate group led by a Pirate Queen and an all-female advisory council. The Sorority remains almost unknown to the public and authorities due to limiting their targets to other criminal organizations which led to a costly confrontation with the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_VEILED_QUEEN_SQUADRON,Fighters: 0.5 / 0
TEXT_TOOLTIP_VENATOR,An iconic carrier-destroyer hybrid. The Republic-designed Star Destroyer was introduced early in the Clone Wars with a large hangar and notable dual-bridge towers. It relies heavily on its fighter complement and is intended to be supported by other vessels such as its counterpart, the Victory-I. It is decently well rounded in spite of its focus on fighter tactics but best not used against larger ships.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_VENATOR_HULL,Hull: 3240 (Heavy Frigate)
TEXT_TOOLTIP_VENATOR_MOVE,Speed: 4.55 | Accel: 0.2 | Turn: 0.4
TEXT_TOOLTIP_VENATOR_REFIT,Common Venator-class refurbishment employed by a variety of groups, such as criminal organisations and small Hutt clans. Availability spikes as Clone Wars surplus is sold to local forces and groups or picked up at mothballs. Consists mostly of weapon modifications intended to aid in support of other capital ships and for piracy operations. Has a hard time killing other capital-scale vessels on its own.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_VICTORY_I_FRIGATE,A versatile fast frigate with diverse weaponry, it is the first iteration of a line with roots in the Clone Wars. It is well-rounded but lacks fighter support and is best used to assist larger capitals.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_VICTORY1,A venerable heavy cruiser, the Republic-designed Star Destroyer is meant to complement the Venator-class by focusing on ship-to-ship combat and system defense. It has a powerful battery of missiles for firepower but is hindered by an archaic drive system. It is best used to deal damage to enemy ships with its missile payload and large gun array.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_VICTORY1_ALT,One of the many refits of the Victory-I Star Destroyer, this variant features longer-barreled turbolasers that replace some of the existing turbos, giving the Victor-class variant a stronger ability to strike from afar and pummel the enemy into submission. In addition token laser defenses have been installed and allow it to ward off any fighters or bombers that break through the frontline to harass the ship.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_VICTORY2,A supplemental version of the Victory that loses the missile-cruiser role for a more generalist armament. It was developed from the Victory-I late in the Clone Wars and was not as popular as it or the Venator, but became more common under the Galactic Empire. It is significantly faster due to an overhauled engine system and outfitted with heavy energy weapons.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_VULTURE_SQUADRON,Bombers: 2 / 0
TEXT_TOOLTIP_WLO5_TANK,The Ubrikkian WLO-5 Speeder tank was a popular choice for pirates and other factions in the Outer Rim due to their cheap price and high mobility which the driver could utilise to evade some attacks although they lacked in firepower compared to the tanks in service with the major powers. The design was also noted to be extremely easy to modify and repair which further boosted its popularity in the less wealthy areas of the galaxy.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_Y_WING,A medium bomber design with a design history started in the Clone Wars. The current S3 model was developed to improve on the B and S1 models that served in the war and saw service into the New Republic. It is best used to attack larger enemy vessels with ion cannons and munitions.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_Z95_BOMBER,Z-95 Headhunters have many sub-models used for a variety of combat roles throughout the galaxy. Variants tuned for anti-ship and ground support are common in lower-priority task groups and local forces, adding munitions racks and mountings at a cost of flight performance.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_Z95_HEADHUNTER,An extremely common and dated fighter in significant use throughout the galaxy. The current series is based on the Mark 2 which replaced the older Mark 1 interceptor and overhauled the design again. This model is armed with the standard laser cannons and missiles.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_ZORBA,Zorba Desilijic Tiure was a Hutt crime lord and the leader of the Desilijic kajidic. One of few Hutts to possess hair—as a result of a genetic throwback—Zorba was the brother of Jiliac, Ebor, Ziro and Pazda, father of Jabba Desilijic Tiure, and grandfather of Rotta, Gorga and Grubba Desilijic Aarrpo. Zorba was an inept leader of Desilijic, and he had few supporters in his clan due to his outlandish schemes and financial mismanagement. During the Separatist Crisis, he was apprehended by law enforcement and sentenced to prison on the planet Kip. Jiliac took over as Desilijic leader and Jabba inherited much of Zorba's holdings.
