TEXT_MISSION_BESPIN_BREAKDOWN_07_INTRO_01,Zukao: I tire of your excuses. Eliminate these Jedi invaders or you will join the corpses of the city.

TEXT_MISSION_BESPIN_BREAKDOWN_15_INTRO_02,At one point these Jedi walked the path of the light just as we do.
TEXT_MISSION_BESPIN_BREAKDOWN_16_INTRO_01,Halcyon: That is why we must stop them.

TEXT_MISSION_CRAZY_CLONE_SPEECH_04,Tars:  ...What? Oh, I'm fine, just distracted. Let's get back to the squad.
TEXT_MISSION_CRAZY_CLONE_SPEECH_05,Sgt. Coop:  Seppie scouts have been spotted in these woods, likely searching for the shield generator.
TEXT_MISSION_CRAZY_CLONE_SPEECH_06, You all know how wily those clankers are, so be prepared for an attack at any moment.
TEXT_MISSION_CRAZY_CLONE_SPEECH_07, Trust in your training and we'll all make it out of this in one piece.
TEXT_MISSION_CRAZY_CLONE_SPEECH_08,Sgt. Coop:  Be careful brothers, droids could be anywhere.

TEXT_MISSION_CRAZY_CLONE_SPEECH_15,Captain Murphy:  Do you remember where you are?  Why did you do this?
TEXT_MISSION_CRAZY_CLONE_SPEECH_16,Tars:  Putting clankers in our own armor, sending me out on my own with them so I thought they were my squad.
TEXT_MISSION_CRAZY_CLONE_SPEECH_17,Even their voices and call signs were programmed to perfectly mimic them, but it wasn't enough. I was made better than that.
TEXT_MISSION_CRAZY_CLONE_SPEECH_18,Captain Murphy:  By the Force.

TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_05,No one chose to watch their homes turn to ashes... But can the Core bring the saving grace they need?
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_05_ALT_01,How long does this have to continue, I ask?  How many more have to die until they see the truth?
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_05_ALT_02,...Meanwhile, unimportant Rim planets like Iseno get prioritised?  Where is the justice in this?
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_06,Or will the war just turn this planet into another graveyard lined with coffins?

TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_06_ALT_02,Rule Davenbay:  Indeed, where is this justice in this?
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_07,This is Rule Davenbay. The local time is 0221 at 15:2:29. Signing out...
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_08,General Grievous:  Citizens of Duro!  This is General Grievous of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_09,I am hereby addressing Chief Representative Officer Hoolidan Keggle.
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_10,This is your one chance to surrender. Lower the planetary shields, or watch your cities burn!
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_11,Hoolidan Keggle:  Never, Duro will not bow to off-worlders!
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_12,General Grievous:  How brave; let us see if it will it persist when your throat is in my grasp. All ships attack the cities!
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_13,General Grievous:  Our primary objective is to disable Jyvus Space City.
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_14,Hoolidan Keggle:  We need to protect the evacuating ships and give them as much time as possible!
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_15,General Grievous:  The station is disabled. Defeat what remains of the defending fleet, while my troops prepare to board Jyvus City!
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_16,Hoolidan Keggle:  The last convoy just escaped the system. Good work!
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_17,General Grievous:  Commencing the assault on the city.
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_18,Republic Officer:  Taskforce 'Sole Ranger' reporting in. Protect the stations. We need to buy the civilians more time to escape the system!

TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DRAMA_SPEECH_01,Hoolidan Keggle:  To all brave soldiers listening, whether you hail from Duro or Kamino, this is our last chance.
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DRAMA_SPEECH_02,We are cornered. The Separatists are landing as I speak, and we cannot expect reinforcements with the blockade in orbit.
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DRAMA_SPEECH_03,I will not offer you false hope, only the truth. I have no intention of letting droid scum take my planet.
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DRAMA_SPEECH_04,If you stand and fight, we will show even steel shall bleed before our resolve.
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DRAMA_SPEECH_05,For Duro, and for the Republic, this is where the line is drawn!
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DRAMA_SPEECH_06,General Grievous: It's over Chief Representative, and Duro lies in ruins. Now for your surrender?
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DRAMA_SPEECH_07,Hoolidan Keggle: Droid scum; Duro will never surrender while I live!

TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_OBJECTIVE_REP_02,Conquer the orbit of Foerost!
TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_SPEECH_01,Captain Mayn:  This is an open message to the Techno Union administration of Foerost.
TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_SPEECH_02,In the wake of Wat Tambor's collaboration with Count Dooku and the Separatist movement
TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_SPEECH_03,the Galactic Senate has ordered all Techno Union-owned systems be placed under martial law.
TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_SPEECH_04,As such, the shipyards of Foerost are to be disarmed under the supervision of trusted corporate representatives
TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_SPEECH_05,from TaggeCo and Kuat Engineering. Any defiance will be seen as treason to the Republic and met with immediate retaliation.
TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_SPEECH_06,You have two minutes to turn off Foerost's planetary shield and surrender.
TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_SPEECH_07,Domb Treetor:  The Techno Union maintains our neutrality, you have no power here.
TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_SPEECH_08,The screeching keeradaks of the Senate cannot bare their fangs at us and expect we present ourselves for slaughter.
TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_SPEECH_09,Captain Mayn:  If this irrelevant peon speaks for the Techno Union, very well.
TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_SPEECH_10,They've been given their chance. Negotiations aren't my forte anyway. All ships, bring down the shipyards!
TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_SPEECH_11,Domb Treetor: The situation is untenable; Foreman Tambor must be informed of this treachery. To any engineers still in orbit, retreat to the planet's surface with any material wealth and shipyard equipment you can take with you.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_01,Headmaster:  I am the king before whom emperors bow. These were the words spoken by the faceless mask.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_02,               I know him. I know his kin. I have heard of the many guises his kind has taken:
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_03,The Chagrians of Champala know him as Aram Acheron; The inhabitants of Iego as Drol Rhamnus; 
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_04,the Rakata call him Nemesis;      And yet most call him the Great Other.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_05,Barsen'thor:  Enough. Ever since you've found this holocron in the catacombs, these walls..    These stones have poisoned your mind, old friend.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_06,               When did Azaël, Keeper of the Flame of Samûnaru, give up reason for madness?
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_07,Headmaster:  Only a fool calls powers beyond their grasp mad!  What I saw is reality!
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_08,               Beings made of light, who could be everywhere and nowhere at once. Vaster than nebulae and tinier than cells!
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_09,They assembled solar systems like children with toys.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_10,I saw birth and death of planets through hands yet to be born. Indescribable powers that are yet to be unleashed.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_11,All of that shrinks to nothing next to .. him.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_12,The Great Other is the One Who Remains. The force that disrupts the balance. Only she can stop him!
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_13,Barsen'thor:  I refused to help our brothers and sisters in their war and defended your decisions.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_14,               I should have abdicated your ways long ago. Whatever you plan, this ends now!

TEXT_MISSION_GIANTS_GRAVEYARD_SPEECH_07,Anakin Skywalker:  Boz Pity... I read it's some sort of graveyard planet. But the size of the memorials...
TEXT_MISSION_GIANTS_GRAVEYARD_SPEECH_08,Obi-Wan Kenobi: The people of this system were giants. We think.
TEXT_MISSION_GIANTS_GRAVEYARD_SPEECH_09,Mace Windu:  The concentration of separatist forces suggests more than just Commander Ventress. If we can capture the confederacy leadership we might be able to end this war.
TEXT_MISSION_GIANTS_GRAVEYARD_SPEECH_10,Count Dooku:  Locate Grievous and Ventress, if they still live. Kill any clones you encounter, but leave the Jedi to me.
TEXT_MISSION_GIANTS_GRAVEYARD_SPEECH_11,Obi-Wan Kenobi:  We rooted the Confederacy here but it doesn't feel like a victory.
TEXT_MISSION_GIANTS_GRAVEYARD_SPEECH_12,Mace Windu:  In any war, the only decisive battle is the last one.
TEXT_MISSION_GIANTS_GRAVEYARD_SPEECH_13,Count Dooku:  A pathetic display by the Jedi... Even if they managed to retreat the planet.

TEXT_MISSION_GUNNING_GUNRAY_OBJECTIVE_CIS_05,Keep the Tranquility alive for the rest of the battle!
TEXT_MISSION_GUNNING_GUNRAY_SPEECH_01,Asajj Ventress:  Our informant has confirmed that Nute Gunray is being held captive on-board this vessel. We need to either destroy or board the ship to prevent him from exposing vital secrets of the CIS.
TEXT_MISSION_GUNNING_GUNRAY_SPEECH_02,Asajj Ventress:  Move one of our ships closer to the Jedi cruiser to begin the boarding maneuver.
TEXT_MISSION_GUNNING_GUNRAY_SPEECH_03,Asajj Ventress:  I will have to speak with my master about this, yet I doubt his mourning will be great.

TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_01_ALT_02,Rule Davenbay: And now a scheduled presentation from the Grand Army of the Republic.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_02,Ultana Anya:  Long time no see, Rule. Glad to finally be back in the Core.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_02_ALT_01,Ryloth Resa:  This broadcast has been liberated by the Shadowfeed, your daily Separatist news update!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_02_ALT_02,Ahalas Svindren: Greetings citizens, this is Major Svindren. I'm here to talk about the topic that won't let itself go ignored; separatism.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_03,Rule Davenbay:  And we're just as glad. What's your initial take on the state of the Outer Rim amid the war, Anya?
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_03_ALT_01,The simpering Kath hounds of the HoloNet are refusing to address the facts, dear listeners. The Separatist Alliance is getting closer to Coruscant by the day.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_03_ALT_02,The worst excesses of rebellion and anarchy tear at our society, but naive minds continue to pay mind to oft debunked arguments.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_04,Ultana Anya:  It's infuriating, Rule. The Separatists and the treacherous aliens in their ranks are determined to destroy civilisation itself.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_04_ALT_01,Count Dooku won't stop until that lying Chancellor and his Jedi pawns are all held accountable for their crimes against freedom and prosperity.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_04_ALT_02,The words of Dooku, whose title is not worth the oxygen it takes to say it, bewitch the masses when they have proven hollow at every turn.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_05,You have Skakoans running roughshod over every backwater they conquer, to the Gossam developing weapons of mass destruction, potentially against Coruscant!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_05_ALT_01,Only then, only then I say, will we have true peace in this galaxy again!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_05_ALT_02,How can one trust a self-proclaimed man of peace, who has schemed to prevent any serious hope of it even among sympathizers in the Senate?
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_06,The meat droids are pushing them back as best as they're programmed too, but the Jedi keep sending them and the Republic into losing battles like Jabiim.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_06_ALT_01,The Republic claims that our heroic freedom fighters are acting akin to HoloNet serial villains, acting without just cause.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_06_ALT_02,Who can trust the nobility of a man who conspires with thugs like Nute Gunray, the worst example of both corporate and Neimoidian culture?
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_07,Our benevolent Chancellor tries to see the best in that archaic order out of tradition, but monks should not be in charge of our military.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_07_ALT_01,Yet it is the Republic's own inefficacy and failure as a governing body, from the Yam'rii Crisis to the Stark Hyperspace War, that is villainous.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_07_ALT_02,Even now when the butcher General Grievous hopes to drown the Core in blood, Dooku's cries of oppression and tyranny do not abate!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_08,All the while, the Jedi have not even accepted any culpability over their 'former' members who participate in this insurrection. It's deplorable!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_08_ALT_01,If it weren't for the Confederacy, the decaying conditions of the Rim would only worsen while the Core fattens itself further off our taxes!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_08_ALT_02,I'd like to take these last moments to address you directly, Dooku. This is not a revolution you have sparked. This is death and finality. 
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_09,Rule Davenbay:  A very passionate report Anya, thank you for your valued contribution.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_09_ALT_01,So I encourage you, don't listen to their propaganda. The truth is out there!  Ryloth Resa out--

TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_03,These criminals held the Senate and our Chancellor hostage to demand the release of one of their own

TEXT_MISSION_JYVUS_JOYRIDE_SPEECH_05,...You can either stay and die on Jyvus, or live to fight another day.

TEXT_MISSION_JYVUS_JOYRIDE_SPEECH_07,K2-B4:  Good work. With the planetary shield deactivated, our forces can begin the assault on the surface.
TEXT_MISSION_JYVUS_JOYRIDE_SPEECH_08,K2-B4:  Keggle's escape doesn't matter in the end. He can only hide on Duro's surface. Prepare the assault.

TEXT_MISSION_JYVUS_JOYRIDE_SPEECH_10,Shall we continue our 'negotiations' for Duro's surrender to the Confederacy?
TEXT_MISSION_JYVUS_JOYRIDE_SPEECH_11,Hoolidan Keggle:  You dare, brute?  Duro will not bear the shame of surrender under my watch.
TEXT_MISSION_JYVUS_JOYRIDE_SPEECH_12,General Grievous:  Would you prefer annihilation?  Duro will fall with your consent or not.
TEXT_MISSION_JYVUS_JOYRIDE_SPEECH_13,With Jyvus City under our control, my droids are deactivating the planetary shields as we speak.

TEXT_MISSION_JYVUS_JOYRIDE_SPEECH_17,Duro would not be the first example I make for the Republic, and it will not be the last.
TEXT_MISSION_JYVUS_JOYRIDE_SPEECH_18,Hoolidan Keggle:   You- You're worse than what even the HoloNet says, a monster...

TEXT_MISSION_LAUGHING_LANCE_SPEECH_04,We're trying to get as many civilians out from the frontlines as possible. Especially if the Seppies are advancing as much as they say.
TEXT_MISSION_LAUGHING_LANCE_SPEECH_05,Sgt. Va'ari:  Someone's been listening to Ryloth Resa too much. Every time her or that sleemo Dooku blabs on the Shadowfeed
TEXT_MISSION_LAUGHING_LANCE_SPEECH_06,those traitors are just covering for the failures of their tin man general. HoloNet News told me all about how they lie.
TEXT_MISSION_LAUGHING_LANCE_SPEECH_07,Cpt. Hunt:  I wish that was the truth, but if you've heard the things these civilians have told me...
TEXT_MISSION_LAUGHING_LANCE_SPEECH_08,Sgt. Va'ari:  You're listening to those rimmer provincials? They're exaggerating, probably hoping to get handouts from the Senate.

TEXT_MISSION_PRAESITLYN_PROBLEMS_SPEECH_03,Anakin Skywalker:  ENOUGH! I don't know your past with Master Halcyon, but for the time being it doesn't matter.
TEXT_MISSION_PRAESITLYN_PROBLEMS_SPEECH_04,It is only a matter of time until the droids get reinforcements from another fleet. A luxury we don't have.
TEXT_MISSION_PRAESITLYN_PROBLEMS_SPEECH_05,The good thing is that our proximity to the communication center means the droids can't risk orbital bombardment.
TEXT_MISSION_PRAESITLYN_PROBLEMS_SPEECH_06,The flip side is that it applies to our ships as well. If we want to survive until tomorrow, we need to work together.
TEXT_MISSION_PRAESITLYN_PROBLEMS_SPEECH_07,Nejaa Halcyon:  What are you proposing, Anakin?
TEXT_MISSION_PRAESITLYN_PROBLEMS_SPEECH_08,Anakin Skywalker:  Grudo, your expertise. Do you think, we have what it takes to risk a frontal assault on an open field towards the base?
TEXT_MISSION_PRAESITLYN_PROBLEMS_SPEECH_09,Grudo:  Normally I bet against the losing hand, but if there is someone who can win any game, it's you.

TEXT_SPEECH_VENATOR_RESEARCH,KDY Representative: The Navy is in dire need of a standardized command ship to combat the threats to our civilization. To show our commitment to the Chancellor, we at Kuat Drive Yards offer just such a ship, which will be substantially armed and able to host a vast number of fighters. This Venator-class will allow Republic officers to take the fight to the Separatists across all fronts, and KDY would be honored if you would sponsor it.

TEXT_SPEECH_VICTORY1_RESEARCH,Walex Blissex: With your approval, Rendili and Kuat have approached me about creating a new type of destroyer for Republic use, the Victory-class. Compared to the Venator's design as a carrier-destroyer, the Victory will serve as a dedicated planetary assault ship featuring numerous turbolasers and missile tubes. My talks with High Command assured me this 'Victor Initiative' will round out the Republic Navy's offensive power significantly, and Kuat Drive Yards and Rendili StarDrive have both expressed interest in developing the initial production line.
TEXT_SPEECH_VICTORY1_RESEARCH_FINISHED,Walex Blissex: A remarkable vessel. With the engineering breakthroughs we tackled developing her, she's just the start of things to come.\n[Victory-I Star Destroyer Unlocked] 
TEXT_SPEECH_VICTORY2_RESEARCH,KDY Representative: The Victor Initiative Project has proven its combat effectiveness and our team at Kuat along with our Rendili counterparts have formulated further ways to improve the existing Victory-I Star Destroyer design. Our proposed Victory-II iteration will include increased speed along with heavy turbolasers and ion cannons, to counter larger Separatist warships. The engineers at Kuat and Rendili are ready if High Command would invest in it, but I assure you it will be well worth it.

We beg you to speak out in support of our motion for a vote of no confidence in the Chancellor.

I promise that I will never lose faith in the Jedi Order, and always to respect their wise counsels, as they are true guardians of the Republic. Though recent years have been darkened by war, I believe it is time for the sun to rise again.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_FUTURE_PALPATINE_SPEECH_01,Palpatine:  I'm told that certain Senators have made unfounded accusations against me. I assure you, I have sought to end this war as swiftly as possible, but the scheming of the Senators has been a greater obstacle to victory than the droid army. You are a hero in the eyes of many wavering Senators - if you were to speak to them, they would surely see things our way.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_FUTURE_PALPATINE_SPEECH_02,Palpatine:  Now that you have proven your loyalty to the Republic, I can tell you the truth: the conspiracy in the Senate has its roots in the Jedi Council! It seems their command over the Grand Army has gone to their heads and now they wish to take over the Republic for themselves. For the Republic to survive, I see no choice but to issue emergency Order 66 immediately.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_FUTURE_PALPATINE_SPEECH_NON_REPUBLIC,Palpatine:  The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger! In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_KDY_CONTRACT_SPEECH_01,Lira Blissex:  My father's Victory Star Destroyer is adequate, but it lacks the power to decisively end the war. My Imperator and her sister ships have the strength the Empire needs to crush the CIS once and for all. You have the Emperor's trust - if you recommend it to him, I'm certain he will approve my new generation of warships for full-scale production.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_KDY_CONTRACT_SPEECH_02,Lira Blissex:  Excellent. A new division of Kuat Drive Yards will focus exclusively on producing my beautiful new Star Destroyers. May they bring swift victory to the Empire in these final battles.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_KUAT_POWER_STRUGGLE_GIDDEAN_SPEECH_01,Kuat of Kuat:  Hello, commander. I have heard this isn't the first time a Kuati official disturbs you in your mission. I apologize for Onara Kuat and understand that she is scared of what Giddean Danu's investigations and reformations may find. I understand she tried to gain your support for having Danu be removed from office? I'd like to see that not happening. My aunt can be persuasive, yet I am sure I can make a better offer.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_KUAT_POWER_STRUGGLE_GIDDEAN_SPEECH_02,Kuat of Kuat:  I am very interested in finding out what my dear aunt feared so much about Danu. Whatever it may be, I hope it will help me getting her out of her office and into a nice retirement home.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_KUAT_POWER_STRUGGLE_ONARA_SPEECH_01,Onara Kuat:  Greetings, youngling. I didn't rise to my position by spending the day on pleasantries, so expect none. My work and I speak for ourselves, and neither of us would want that to change. The Republic needs our ships. Something the Chancellor knows and respects. Yet some senators like Giddean Danu of my own home planet of Kuat seem to not understand the importance of KDY and Kuat in the galaxy. I have set in motion a referendum to have that annoyance be recalled and your support in the senate and throughout the galaxy in unmatched. If you help me, it might prove useful for you.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_KUAT_POWER_STRUGGLE_ONARA_SPEECH_02,Onara Kuat:  My recent flagship is nearing completion and will likely just gather dust above Kuat. I am sure you will find it a useful extension of your naval forces.\n[Onara Kuat can be upgraded on Kuat to a Mandator-II]

TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ORDER_66_SPEECH_12,PALPATINE: POWER! UNLIMITED POWER!
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ORDER_66_SPEECH_13,ANAKIN: What have I done?
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ORDER_66_SPEECH_14,PALPATINE: You are fulfilling your destiny, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ORDER_66_SPEECH_15,ANAKIN: I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ORDER_66_SPEECH_16,PALPATINE: Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader. Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators. Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_SECTOR_GOVERNANCE_DECREE_MOTHMA_SPEECH_01,Mon Mothma:  I'm told that the Chancellor is considering a decree that will transfer more power to the sector army commanders from local authorities. I don't believe we must further empower the military governors to win the war. I fear that if we do, it will be impossible to return to civilian government. Please, I implore you to speak against this measure.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_SECTOR_GOVERNANCE_DECREE_MOTHMA_SPEECH_02,Mon Mothma:  Democracy and freedom won out against dictatorship today, thanks to you. It will be difficult to resist the temptations of authoritarianism as the war continues, but you've given me hope that we can save the soul of the Republic while defeating the Confederacy. Thank you.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_SECTOR_GOVERNANCE_DECREE_PESTAGE_SPEECH_01,Sate Pestage:  No doubt certain nay-sayers in the Senate have come to you speaking ill of the Chancellor's upcoming sector governance decree. Surely, you recognize that our soldiers can't bring us victory without the entire force of the Republic aligned behind them. The Chancellor has every confidence that you will support our troops.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_SECTOR_GOVERNANCE_DECREE_PESTAGE_SPEECH_02,Sate Pestage:  You have as keen an eye for politics as you do the battlefield, Commander. With this, the sector armies can be managed much more efficiently and the war will end all the faster. And when it is over, who can say how much higher your star may rise? The Chancellor does not forget his friends... Or his enemies.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_SECTORS_JOINED,Republic Senator: The local sector forces of Republic worlds across the Galaxy have become fully integrated into the war effort, commander. The full resources of the Republic are now in your hands.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_SPECIAL_TASKFORCE_COMMITTEE_PALPATINE_SPEECH_01,Supreme Chancellor Palpatine:  Greetings, Commander. How is your mission going? I hear you are making successes, yes? One of my most brilliant advisors, Umak Leth, is fascinated by your reports about this ... superweapon. He says that this technology might prove very useful in the future and that we should invest more forces into this mission.

We suspect that Grievous plans to attack a medical station near the Kaliida Nebula. Our mission is to destroy this weapon and hopefully kill this coward of a droid in the process.

TEXT_STORY_MALEVOLENCE_HUNT_REP_SPEECH_02,Chancellor Palpatine:  I have bad news, my friend. Several parts of your fleets were redirected for the evacuation.

TEXT_STORY_RIMWARD_CRAWL_BODY_02,Unknown to the Jedi, the attacks are merely a distraction to divide Republic forces further, luring more and more fleets away from Grievous' real target, the birthplace of the Clone Army, with his plan centred around a small outpost on an unimportant moon.

Famously used in a modified form by General Grievous as his personal starfighter, the design had mild continuity among mercenary groups and resistance cells afterwards.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_BELBULLAB23,Variant Belbullab design that acts as a heavy assault craft. Armed with heavier weaponry, it is well suited to engage Republic fighters such as the ARC-170, but is more rarely sighted compared to the more standard fighter and bomber Belbullab starfighters.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_BELBULLAB24,Derivative of the Belbullab design spun into an average-performance bomber. Used as a more individually powerful asset compared to swarms of lighter droid bombers, and remained more popular with holdouts and small cells afterwards due to the pilotable nature.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_BTLA2_Y_WING,Early model of Y-wing tuned more towards a multirole fighter than assault bomber role.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_COMP_SUPPORTER,Organized Commission for the Protection of the Republic thugs given surplus light armour and sidearms that can be concealed when in civilian life. Fanatical from increasingly xenophobic propaganda and willing to be used as militia, tripwire assets and political enforcers for the organization. Mostly effective against under-equipped partisans even when in large numbers, but can occupy other forces with sheer body count.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_CONSULAR_MOVE,Speed: 6.65 | Accel: 0.25 | Turn: 0.65

TEXT_TOOLTIP_COY,A straightforward human male with little care for sensitivity or humility. During the Clone Wars became one of the first Moffs and the officer in charge of Ivory Fang Sector Command.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_COYOTE_BOMBER,This wartime direct upgrade to an older Droid Bomber design spun off from the Vulture series. Employed by the Trade Federation in the subjugation of its corporate interests, and would fly under CIS colors when the Trade Federation pledged its military to the Separatists. It is similar to its peer the Hyena Bomber in role and power, swarming enemy capital ships to cripple or eliminate them while pushing through Republic fighter forces. Unusually for the size and design it is equipped with a weak shield, though it does make other performance sacrifices in comparison.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_CRABDROID,The most common iteration of a product line intended to bolster Techno Union profits rather than win wars, this model of crab droid serves as a light anti-infantry unit and, less commonly, espionage, light and medium armor variants. It is well suited for close-up assaults against infantry groups and light vehicles.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_DALESHAM,Dalesham was a Separatist General who led CIS forces on Innton II within the Triton system. When the Recusant-class Nova Defiant was shot down by Republic Star Destroyers and crashed on Innton II's surface, Dalesham concocted a plan to scavenge its remains and use its salvaged pieces to form a new base in a massive cavern on the planet. Under Dalesham's orders the most important sections of the ship such as the bridge and officers' galley were transferred, but the Clone Wars ended before the base could be completed.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DALLIN,Career military man from the planet Rendili with a deep love for the Galactic Republic. Served as an aide to Militarist Senator Ranulph Tarkin and as second-in-command of Tarkin's military, the Republic Outland Regions Security Force. Dallin fought in the Stark Hyperspace war and later served in the Republic Judicial Forces before returning to his homeworld to join the Rendili Home Defense Fleet.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_DARMAN,RC-1136 was a Clone Commando who adopted the name Darman. Darman was the sole survivor of Theta squad in their first battle deployment to Geonosis and then reassigned to Omega Squad as the demolitions specialist. During the Clone Wars Darman would secretly marry a Padawan named Etain Tur-Mukan and even had a son with her, although she would die during Order 66. Despite being formally adopted into Clan Skirata, Darman was unable to desert the Empire like half of Omega Squad and was forced to become an Imperial Commando in Squad 40.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DEFOLIATOR,An unusual artillery piece designed by Lok Durd to fit onto an AAT chasis. Specialty munitions use a chain-reaction incendiary energy type to cause effective wide-area damage against less-protected organic infantry and operators, but little against shielded or armoured targets. This model being built atop an AAT-1 provides the artillery with the defensive capabilities of the base design.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_DELLSO,Gizor Dellso was a Geonosian engineer who helped design the shutdown codes for the Trade Federation droid army. After his code was used, he refused to admit defeat and reactivated the droid foundry on Mustafar, building up a significant force before falling to the 501st Legion.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DELTA,The Republic's top and most venerable Clone Commando squad that is typically assigned to the most dangerous and critical missions available, with a penchant for coming out on top. It consists of four clone commandos: "Boss", "Fixer", "Scorch", and "Sev".
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DELTA_HEALTH,Health: 110 [1%/5s] (Hero)

TEXT_TOOLTIP_DELTA_WEAP4,1x Sonic Grenade: 1 / 15.0s / 200m
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DELTA6,Outdated by the onset of the Clone Wars and replaced by the larger and much more capable Delta-7 Aethersprite. The Delta-6 is a fighter designed in the long tradition of lightweight and stripped-down fighters designed for Force users such as the Jedi. Effectively an engine with 2 laser cannons, the Delta relies on the special abilities of force users to excel but due to its cheap nature it is not uncommon for PDF forces to use the fighter with normal pilots. 
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DELTA7,A high performance KSE interceptor designed by Walex Blissex introduced right before the Clone Wars, the Delta-7 Aethersprite is considerably advanced for its time and expensive to match. The Jedi Order took a liking to the craft and it became the standard flight craft of many Jedi Knights for travel and reconnaissance in their duties. Armed with twin-barrelled laser cannons and powerful sub-light engines, its main weakness is a lack of internal hyperdrive due to lack of space, necessitating an external hyperdrive docking ring.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DENIMOOR,Denimoor served with K'Kruhk in the Siege of Saleucami. He remained in the navy after the New Order was declared, though he did not agree with the excesses of Palpatine's regime and once quietly covered the trail of his old Jedi comrade.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DEVASTATION,The Devastation is a modified Subjugator Heavy Cruiser, developed in secret as a sister ship to Malevolence. Instead of the dual ion pulse cannons of its base frame, it features a forward mounted axial superlaser, powered by Force crystals harvested by Nightsisters in the service of the Confederacy. The Devastation loses some of the gun emplacements of a standard Subjugator to make room for this massive superlaser, while also adding missile emplacements where the ion cannons were originally built.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_DEVASTATION_WEAP5,1x Axial Superlaser: 1 / 180.0s / 40.0km
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DEVISS,Deviss started the Clone wars as the Clone Captain of K Company in the 327th Star Corps under Bly. After several acts of valour and initiative during the Clone Wars he would become promoted to a Commander where he was assigned to Jedi General Nem Bees.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_DFS1VR,A Vulture droid starfighter in the service of the Trade Federation, DFS-1VR participated in the Battle of Naboo and was one of the few Vultures to persist into the Clone Wars. As one of the most experienced droid brains in the Confederate navy's arsenal, DFS-1VR was placed in the lead of the durable 31st Flight of Vulture fighters.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DH_OMNI,A dated corporate cargo hauler converted into a general purpose fleet support craft in an attempt to shift logistics burdens away from the Trade Federation. It is used as a fleet tender and to deploy interdiction mines - the most reliable method of hyperspace prevention in the era. It is durable and well-protected from fighters but vulnerable to larger enemy vessels.

They were disposed towards disturbing cybernetic and biological experiments, including the creation of a chimeric pet named Seventeen. Doctor would take charge of Project Instinction, a multi-stage plan which intended to disrupt the major agriworld of Ukio and deprive the Republic of its harvests.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DODONNA_CW,Commenor-born soldier who fought in the Stark Hyperspace War, serving on a cruiser. He has risen to prominence as a sound naval commander and quickly given command of a Star Destroyer. He has a keen grasp of strategy and is a premier tactician along with his comrades Screed and Adar Tallon.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DOOKU,Count Dooku was a Jedi Master who was one of the best swordsmen in the Order and the former master of Qui-Gon Jinn. When his faith in the Jedi was shaken, Dooku would fall under the sway of Darth Sidious and leave the Order. Claiming his birthright as Count of Serenno, he secretly adopted the title Darth Tyranus. As the Separatist movement gained momentum Dooku became its public leader, publicly denouncing the Republic and conspiring with corporate leaders to support the nascent rebellion. Throughout the Clone Wars Dooku would be a formidable foe on and off the battlefield with his Dark Side and oratory skills.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_DRALLIG,An esteemed Jedi Master and swordsman of nearly unparelled skill, Cin Drallig served as both a lightsaber combat trainer and the head of security for the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. He is a living embodiment of the Jedi Order's tenets, giving himself completely to the will of the Force and dedicating his life to teaching Jedi Padawans the Order's values and beliefs. Drallig took on Serra Keto as his own padawan when no other master could get through her fiery temper, and trained her as his star pupil.

Secondarily the spikes could be opened to grab onto objects and then closed to crush the grappled object in their vices.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_DROGEN_HOSH,A commander within the Droid Army, Drogen Hosh led the Separatist invasion of the planet Argul. Hosh's invasion successfully captured many key positions on the planetary capital of Lumica, cornering the Republic defenders along with many refugees. He offered the commanding Jedi a chance to surrender, saying they and any Argullians who wished to leave could do so if they gave up the planets administration to him. As a show of good faith Hosh even offered himself as a hostage to guarantee the deal, and hoped to enlist the Jedi into the Separatist cause.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DROID_R2D2,Originally an astromech on Queen Amidala's personal starship, R2-D2 critically assisted the Queen's escape from the Trade Federation blockade of the planet, and eventually assisted the young Anakin Skywalker in destroying the Droid Control Ship.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_DRON,Dron accompanied the Jedi Keelyvine Reus and Kit Fisto on a mission to secure the agriworld of Ukio, where he was key in identifying the Confederate strategy to block the sunlight and force the planet to lower its shields. Though Dron was able to drive the Separatists away, they soon managed to purchase a controlling interest in the planet in the wake of the economic disruption of their attack.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DUA_NINGO,An aging Sullustan with a long service record in the Commerce Guild's Sullustan Home Guard.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAA,Built on mass during the dying period of the Clone Wars, the Mankvim was a light and cheap interceptor which made up for its bad armour and weak weaponry with high speed and numbers. Their short range limited them to planetary defence or carrier operations. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAB,Pairing swarm fighters, Vultures, with swarm bombers, Hyenas, was a cheap and efficient way of dominating the battle space. With sheer numbers, even if a few are shot down, the payload was still delivered and the damage was done.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAC,The Confederacy preferred to establish fighter supremacy through the weight of sheer numbers. Vulture droid fighters were proven to be highly effective in this role. While the Vultures tied down and surrounded enemy fighters, Scarab fighters were able to clean up dogfights and clear the battle space.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAD,In order to support their own capital ships and deal with the Republic’s fleets, the CIS grouped long range fire support ships, such as the ion equipped Munifex, or the turbolaser focused Marauder, together to help whittle down shields and hull of enemy vessels.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAE,In order to rapidly deploy fighters and bombers to establish fighter superiority, the Trade Federation’s C-9979 Carrier was extensively used throughout the Clone Wars by the Confederacy. In order to escort the fragile carrier in hostile space, the Techno Union provided Hardcell missile boats to provide some protection.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAF,In order to protect their larger ships and escort bomber squadrons, the Confederacy organised small wolf packs of anti-fighter Diamond corvettes with Gozanti flotillas accompanying the corvettes to herd enemy fighters and bombers into range of the Diamond’s extensive rapid laser batteries.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAG,Mercenary groups often have access to surprisingly powerful equipment and since the CIS corporations can afford the exorbitant prices, the mercenaries were happy to lend their aid in a variety of engagements. These mercenaries were contracted to provide fighter and bomber support where ordered.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAH,A Planet with divided Loyalties in the war, a significant number of Mandalorians would contract themselves to the CIS despite the neutral status of their homeworld. Some would just be single warriors in search of a payday but lots would band together into mercenary groups or join as an entire Clan. These latter groups would also bring with them their own fighters and gunships which could be used to aid CIS fleets against the growing fighter strength of the Republic Navy. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAI,Before the Clone Wars, the Trade Federation commissioned KDY to build them ships they could use to combat pirate threats. When the Clone Wars broke out, the Trade Federation provided their extensive stockpile of Captor class carriers and  Auxilia class frigates to the Confederacy’s war effort.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAJ,Kolivex corvettes, designed by Geonosian PDF engineers, provided effective point defence against enemy ordnance. In order to help defend the corvette and other ships, Nantex fighters could be launched from the Kolivex.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAK,The small Hardcell tenders can provide support for allied fighter swarms and bombers, but they are fragile. In order to protect the Hardcells, CIS high command assigned Lupus Missile Frigates.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAL,All across the galaxy, planets utilised the ubiquitous Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser by Rendili for defence against any number of threats. Often these ships would be backed up by smaller, more agile corvettes. When the Clone Wars broke out and spread throughout the galaxy, these planetary defence forces got rolled into the Confederacy’s proper naval forces as valuable assets.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAM,In addition to providing loans and funding to the Confederacy, the Intergalactic Banking Clan also contributed significant military force to the Confederacy Navy, primarily in the form of well armed, though fragile, Munificent Communications ships and the Recusant class destroyers.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAN,Mercenary groups often have access to surprisingly powerful equipment and since the CIS corporations can afford the exorbitant prices, the mercenaries were happy to lend their aid in a variety of engagements. This group was contracted to provide heavy firepower support in a variety of engagements.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAP,As the Clone Wars dragged on, the CIS needed to update their fighters to compete with the Republic’s rapid R&D. The Tri-Fighter proved effective as an interceptor when paired with the Vulture swarms that could easily tie down the enemy.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAQ,The Belbullab fighter and bomber loadouts proved to be rather deadly in the right hands, capable of dishing out more damage and soaking more damage than their swarm counterparts, these fighters and bombers would be deployed by the CIS in more dangerous battle spaces.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAR,Mercenary groups often have access to surprisingly powerful equipment and since the CIS corporations can afford the exorbitant prices, the mercenaries were happy to lend their aid in a variety of engagements. The entire mercenary fleet was contracted to provide full support for the forces engaged in this battle.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAS,In order to break down enemy defences, a siege force requires significant supplies. The DH Omni ship can resupply major forces while the surprisingly manoeuvrable Lucrehulk Core Destroyer and Ginivex fighters defend the cumbersome supply vessel.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAT,The Recusant droid ship, and the larger dreadnought variant, were both designed to provide significant fire support from a distance. They can pepper heavy fire into enemy lines from across a battle space and should enemy fighters or bombers attempt to flank them, they have supplemental lasers to defend themselves.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAU,Engagements requiring a smaller, but still powerful force proved to be the perfect place to pair the deadly ship-to-ship firepower of the Bulwark with the heavy carrier/destroy hybrid Providence.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAV,Having significant firepower from the many ordnance launch bays at the prow of the ships, the Providence C/D and the larger Providence Dreadnoughts could fill many fleet roles and were capable of operating independently given their significant hangar capacity.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAW,To compete with larger and deadlier Republic ships of the late Clone Wars, the CIS took the Bulwark design and improved upon it, creating an even larger and deadlier vessel that could stand toe-to-toe against enemy capital ships.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAX,Lucrehulk Battlecarriers proved very effective in deterring enemy assaults due to how much firepower they could soak before getting severely damaged. As such they provided the perfect escort to the more fragile, Munificent. These ships could help protect the Lucrehulk from direct assault while the Lucrehulk soaked enemy firepower.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAY,The Lucrehulk Battleship traded some of its internal hangar capacity for a much stronger direct firepower loadout of turrets and turbolasers. When assigned to accompany Providence Dreadnoughts and Recusant Dreadnoughts, the resulting firepower and still significant fighter and bomber complement proved to be a powerful fleet to be reckoned with.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAZ,The Subjugator’s heavy ion cannon proved effective in engagements, but the lack of any support fleet showed a major weakness to bomber assaults. In order to rectify this oversight, the CIS assigned smaller vessels to accompany future Subjugator class ships on any missions. Auxilias and Captors provide excellent fire support and some protection against enemy bombers. Recusants could keep enemy ships at bay long enough for the ion cannon to do its work.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AIR_RAIDER,Both the HMP and MAF are devastating Gunships for the CIS with high mobility and firepower. They are able to pick and choose their fights, able to run from anything they cannot kill easily. BX Commando teams hitching a lift on the MAF gunships are able to quickly land and secure any gains made by the roaming gunships and potentially even securing a forward base for the CIS. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_ANTI_AIR_BATTERY,While many of the CIS ground assets are capable of some levels of anti air fire, the sheer variety and quantity of Republic airspeeders ranging in capability from the LAAT to the Gaba demands the deployment of a dedicated anti air vehicle where Republic air assets are expected. These important vehicles are weak to a ground attack and are frequently assigned a ground escort to ensure their protection from raids or at least fend off the attack long enough for the HAMLs to retreat back to protection. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_ARMOUR_ASSAULT,The Protodeka is one of many examples of CIS super vehicle designs that never went into mass production. A devastating force alone let alone supported by the firepower of Magna Tri droids and Hailfires. This force can easily overwhelm most Republic positions with ease. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_ARTILLERY,The HAG-M is the CIS indirect artillery vehicle capable of providing long range devastating fire from safety. The J-1 conversely is a direct fire artillery piece capable of providing heavy hits against large targets in line of sight. BX Commando Snipers can sometimes be attached to provide spotting and fire correction back to the artillery pieces.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_B1_DETACHMENT,The B1, the main infantry of the CIS, is a cheap, flimsy, mass produced combat droid that is really only effective when deployed in mass where the sheer weight of fire from massed carbines can compensate for all its flaws. A repair droid squad is attached to make a token attempt to keep the droid numbers up and reduce combat attrition.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_DEBT_COLLECTION_FORCE,The vast majority of the forces of the CIS came from the private pre-war security forces of several corporations. While meant for “protection” from pirates, these forces were often used to intimate others into securing their business interests or collect perceived debts owed to the megacorporations. Persuader tanks were geared especially towards this task and then repurposed towards shock assaults in the Clone wars. They often were accompanied with Hailfires whose fragile frame often needed protection from attack whilst their missiles rained destruction down any resistance. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_DESTROYER_FORMATION,Destroyer Droids were some of the most feared types of the commonly seen CIS droid infantry types due to their high speed, heavy firepower, and shield generators. The Mk2 version is an even more deadly version with even more guns and ion cannons. A strike force of destroyer droids is lethal to any infantry and even small vehicles with the mass of blaster fire. LR-57 droids lumber behind the nimble destroyers to secure the positions devastated in their wake, freeing up the destroyers to move on to a new target.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_HEAVY_INFANTRY,The B2 is a straight upgrade to the standard B1 design but would never fully replace the B1 in service due to the ease of mass production for the b1. This stronger droid can be supported in combat with the cheaper B1s which have been given better weapons than just massed carbine fire. This pairing has much more firepower and durability than the normal B1 formation. Infantry however tend to be slow and thus PACs are often deployed to carry infantry rapidly forward into the battle.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_HUNTER_KILLER,While the vast majority of CIS infantry forces were massed B1 droids, not all CIS droids were low quality and there were lots of higher quality designs. The Crab droid and Destroyer droids are both fast infantry droids with lots of protection and firepower which can react to threats around the battlefield and support the cheap slow B1s.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_INFILTRATION_TEAM,The BX series Commando Droids are highly expensive but mobile infiltration droids used as special forces for the CIS. Attached Mechanised Assault Flyers allow for even more mobility by acting as a gunship transport for the Commando Droids.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_LIGHT_ARMOUR,Both the GAT and OG-9 are glass cannon vehicles which are highly mobile, pack lots of firepower, but cannot take much damage in return. These glass cannon designs can retreat to the slow bulk of an MTT as a shield from heavy return fire thus acting as a secure pivot point for the more mobile vehicles. This highly mobile force can hit any Republic weak point and retreat from overwhelming enemy presence.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_MANDO_MERCENARY,Not all forces that took part in the Clone Wars were associated with either major faction. Such times of strife allowed many groups to sell their services to the highest bidder. While the government of Mandalore may have remained officially neutral in the conflict, not all Mandalorians accepted this pacifism but sought to maintain their old warlike ways even if it meant fighting other’s wars. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_MEDIUM_ARMOUR,AATs and Persuader tanks were the common tanks deployed by the CIS and in a large number they are capable of overwhelming most opposition especially when escorted by decent quality infantry. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_RECON,STAPs are the CIS version of a speeder bike and their job is to scout out the enemy. When the hostiles have been located the STAP will harass to pin down the enemy to pin and delay enemy forces while heavier forces are brought up although weak forces of infantry can be eliminated by a concentrated swarm of STAPs. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_TRADE_FED_ARMOUR_FORCE,Sometimes the deployment of MTTS and their stowed infantry is not enough to overwhelm enemy positions. In those cases the formation can easily be bolstered with the attachment of several AATs to provide additional firepower from behind the safety of the B1 swarm and mass of the MTTs
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_TRADE_FED_INFANTRY_FORCE,The MTT was a large troop transport that could bring masses of folded up B1s into a battle and then support them with their long range lasers. The appearance of MTTs on any battlefield heralded the deployment of swarms of CIS battle droids. On occasion heavier infantry types like destroyers droids would be transported along as well to supplement the power of the infantry. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_WALKER_ASSAULT,The Magna Tri droid is a large combat walker deployed by the CIS to deal with heavy vehicle threats or crush fortified positions. A swarm of B1 Droids protect it from any close range infantry support while OG-9s pour additional fire on the enemy from the relative safety behind the Magna Tri Droids.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAA,Not all forces that took part in the Clone Wars were associated with either major faction. Such times of strife allowed many groups to sell their services to the highest bidder. While the government of Mandalore may have remained officially neutral in the conflict, not all Mandalorians accepted this pacifism but sought to maintain their old warlike ways even if it meant fighting other’s wars.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAB,The Hutt are long lived and slow to reproduce. So not only do they believe themselves above the need to be common foot soldiers out of egotism, there is also a practical reason for this aversion. Why risk the precious life of a true hutt when the life of one of the many worthless slave and client races can take on all the risk of being frontline infantry. Their numbers form the core of any Hutt military ground operation and are commonly used to screen for more valuable pieces of equipment or for the rare occasions when lesser Hutts take to the field themselves. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAC,Speeders are very common and popular amongst the various humanoid client races under the Hutts for their extreme speed and manoeuvrability and their ability to armed with weapons stronger than what a regular soldier could carry over the same distances, including disruptors for those not caring about Galactic norms. While this mobility is useful for reconnaissance ahead of any regular ground forces, it also allows for hit and fade tactics to be used on the enemy to pin them in place and attrite their forces down if used judiciously. A careless commander however can easily get these speeder forces massacred if they overcommit or are careless as the pilots of these vehicles have next to no protection from enemy fire.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAD,Hutt society generally looks down upon Hutts who sully themselves by serving as somewhat regular infantry rather than just throwing expendable slaves, mercenaries, or clients into the meat grinder. Even so these lesser Hutts are still considered to be far more valuable tactically and socially than the aforementioned alternatives and their lives are still somewhat valuable. The heavy suits of armour serve both to help keep these Hutts alive through the dangers of the battlefield while also allowing them to bring large amounts of firepower for infantry. They are also often accompanied by retinues of client or slave soldiers who serve both as “ablative armour” for the Hutts and also to stop the small formations of Hutt warriors for being swarmed by a foe almost certainly more numerous. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAE,With the vast amount of worlds the Hutts operate the terrain is often best described as rugged which makes repulsorlift and airborne vehicles very popular options for vehicular mobility. The Tape Skiff is their primary option for vehicle ground to air options with its many missile launchers. The Pongeeta Speeder is often tasked with escorting the Tape Skiffs to keep them safe from any infantry assault. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAF,The Hutt switch to active militarism left them in a position of having an underdeveloped military industrial complex and thus are forced to to rely on converted civilian designs, which on Hutt worlds have a tendency to be repulsorlift craft. The Bantha Skiff has light blasters suited to dealing with clusters of infantry while the Superhaul Skiff packs multiple anti-vehicle missile launchers to deal with hardened targets. In concert these highly mobile skiffs can appear out of nowhere and devastate small out of positioned formations while easily maintaining a safe distance from more formidable threats. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAG,These small flyers are routinely used by various Hutt groups to maintain aerial reconnaissance over important buildings and locations. In times of active conflict small groups of them are sent out ahead of the main bulk of Hutt forces to locate any enemy ground forces and constantly harass them until they are weakened enough for other Hutt forces to wipe out. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAH,As the intensity of warfare increases on the ground, so do the risk towards the Hutt lives who stoop to the level of actively engaging in combat. Their combat armour can only do so much to maintain their health whilst under a barrage of laser fire. Their slave soldiers only have so many lives to give for the sake of their masters. The allocation of Personnel IV Skiffs to such Hutt warbands provides a reasonable increase in firepower against opposing infantry forces but also it brings a significant amount of Bacta and other medical supplies to treat any injuries the Hutt Warriors may receive. If the local commander is feeling generous these medical supplies can also be used to treat casualties taken from the retinue of slave soldiers. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAI,Shell Hutts are a minority of the Hutt race who have dedicated their lives to wearing ever increasing sizes of power armour. This power armour is highly customised to suit each Hutt encased inside and virtually always includes multiple weapons systems attached to the armour’s frame. While these Minor Shell Hutts are still relatively small (for a Shell Hutt) they can still bring weapon systems more commonly seen on small and medium sized dedicated military vehicles. Their limited numbers does present a risk of getting swarmed in combat and thus these Hutts nearly always bring a high quality retinue for added protection such as the ancient wardroids once used by Xim the Despot which still somehow perform at good standard for wardroids despite their extreme age, a testament to their advanced construction and quality control millennia ago. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAJ,The rugged nature of the vast majority of Hutt worlds also informed their choice of tank in addition to their preference for Skiffs for their lighter vehicles. The WLO-5 repulsor tank which lacks the same levels of firepower of the mainline tanks used by the Republic and CIS but is noticeably more mobile. This allows the WLO-5 to attempt to dictate the pace of battle against a more ponderous foe while also allowing them to maintain formation with the swarms of smaller Skiffs utilised in a militarised role by the Hutts and thus mutually support each other. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAK,Minor Shell Hutts straddle the boundary between infantry and light vehicles due to their size and firepower but their numbers are few. One countermeasure employed by the Hutts to increase the survivability of these Shell Hutts is to provide retinues of soldiers or droids to provide extra numbers and screen for the Hutts. Another popular tactic is partner formations of Shell Hutts with gunships which can transport soldiers. The resilient VAAT/E is often entrusted to this role of safely delivering Shell Hutts to their designated targets, providing air support for their mission, and then exfiltrating them once the mission is completed or the enemy have managed to mobilise sufficient mass of force to properly threaten the lives of the Hutts on the ground. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAL,The ancient Hutt Empire was extremely expansionist which threw it into multiple wars. The one against Xim the Despot was near cataclysmic in its destruction and was a major factor for the Hutts turning away from such open militarism. However one major boon for the Hutts from the War was the capture of the warbot army utilised by Xim which was so advanced for their time that these warbots remain viable for deployment during the Clone Wars if the Hutts decide to reactive them for active service rather than keeping them reserved as statue guards for their Palaces.  
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAM,As the Hutts slowly return to their ancient militarism, they became more and more willing to take risks with the lesser Hutts who served as infantry in some forms. Their relatively small numbers made up for this by their natural resilience being heavily bolstered by powered armour, which also allows these Hutts to bring more firepower than a humanoid infantry soldier. Instead of relying on mobility or large retinues to protect them from being swarmed by large numbers of enemies, the Hutts are now willing to just bring more Hutts to the fight and deploy them in a solid mass where their qualitative superiority will compensate for their quantitative inferiority. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAN,The Hutt usage of the WLO-5 as their mainline tank has granted Hutt ground forces better mobility than their peers although combat experience has found that it has come at a cost of firepower. Some Hutt commanders attempt to compensate for this by attaching smaller Skiffs to companies of WLO-5s, the alternative popular organisational choice has been to subordinate batteries of MAL repulsor artillery platforms. The WLO-5 tanks are deployed ahead of the MALs to locate and pin enemy forces which then allows the MALs to deploy their missile launchers from the travel locks and then unleash a massive barrage upon the enemy. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAO,The Republic and the CIS deployed a wide range of gunships and flyers in their ground forces both for the deployment of troops and in ground attack roles. This influenced the Hutts to develop their own gunship formations in response with the VAAT/E gunships operating in concert with a small swarm of Hutt Atmospheric Flyers. The latter operate to spot targets and distract enemy anti air fire away from the latter which provides the bulk of the staying power and the optional ability to transport infantry along for the operation.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAP,The Gamorreans are formidable close range warriors with an axe or blaster pistol due to their bulk providing a lot of survivability when under fire in addition to the constant training encouraged by their native warrior culture. Personnel Skiffs IVs with medical supplies follow in the wake of the charging mass of Gamorreans to treat any injuries and rapidly return the wounded to fighting condition. The blasters on the Skiffs can also provide suppressing fire to assist the Gamorreans close into melee range with the enemy. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAQ,Once a civilian vessel that were luxurious status symbols of various Hutts, these Luxury sail barges have been commandeered and retrofitted to something approaching a military standard then given over as command vessels for local Hutt commanders. While these barges now bristle with weapons, they still pale in comparison to the heavy assault vehicles commonly deployed by the Republic and CIS and thus they nearly always have their own escort of repulsorlift tanks and skiffs in order to rapidly destroy the enemy. The militarisation of these barges also make them viable mass transports of infantry with all the living and work space dedicated for guests and slaves having been converted to space for the transport of slave soldiers and warrior Hutts into battle.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAA,The Z95 is an extremely common snub fighter for mercenary and other independent formations in the galaxy. This means the Hutts can easily hire cheap and disposable fighter squadrons to patrol and garrison areas of space where the Hutts do not bother to openly display their military might.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAB,For the last few millennia the Hutts have strove to minimise any image of them possessing conventional military capacity. Hence when small conflicts arise the Hutts will usually contract mercenaries to deal with the conflict and not all merc groups are equal in strength and focus. While they are still likely to be dependent on open market or older starfighter designs, some groups are able to form stronger formations capable of engaging and destroying corvettes and frigates on their own.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAC,The Minstrel series of Yachts are most commonly used as personal Yachts by individual Hutts which justified their relatively heavy weapon loadout for seemingly civilian ships. These armaments also mean that the minstrels can very easily be converted into purpose military corvettes when an actual conflict flares up enough for the Hutts to actually dedicate their real navy in response. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAD,The venerable Juvard frigate makes for the perfect patrol and picket frigate for the Hutts. It is strong and fast enough to deal with any pirates or mercenary groups who are foolish enough to operate against the Hutts or any unrest from the Hutt’s many client species; while also being old enough that no one who sees these dated vessels would fear the Hutts are starting to remilitarise. If needed the even older Kaloth Battlecruisers can be “generously donated” from loyal mercenaries and client races and attached to groups of Juvards to rapidly swell the numbers of frigates operating in an area.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAE,Successful mercenary groups, or at least those with wealthy and generous backers, are able to expand their operations to afford the acquisition and running maintenance cost of one or more corvettes. Cheap and widely produced corvettes tend to be the ones chosen by these groups and then heavily up-armed over their stock configurations. These groups can be contracted to rapidly expand the corvette forces of the Hutt Cartels without giving away their true military strength or can be used as a roving hunter killer formation used in support of conventional Hutt Navy deployments.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAF,While small grouping of Headhunter fighter squadrons are sufficient to deal with the demands of garrison duty or anti piracy patrols in backwater planets; two squadrons are insufficient to deal with the needs of any real conflict. When mercenaries are expected to be deployed in situations where such an elevated threat exists it has often proven prudent to contract additional squadrons of fighters. More Squadrons of Z95s provide the mass needed to engage and tie down snub fighters while heavier fighter types such as the highly modifiable Cloakshape can deploy additional firepower to rapidly destroy the hostiles. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAG,Independent groups who are adverse to taking losses or find themselves with requirements not suitable for mass deployment of fighter squadrons but are not wealthy to afford corvettes or larger ship tend to gravitate toward the various models of gunships that exist in the galaxy. The Gozanti raider refit provides extensive firepower in a small package allowing squadrons of these to successfully engage vessels much larger than themselves while the Mandalorian Kom'rk exists as a massively oversized fighter craft and occasionally transport. In tandem a wing of these gunships can successfully engage the vast majority of targets either for piracy or as long range raiders in warfare.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAH,The  Kuat Systems Engineering Morningstar picket fighter is a highly customisable design which meant that while it was intended for planetary defence forces it found favour in other groups such as various groups affiliated with the Hutts. The A variant was designed as a multirole craft able to engage other fighters with lasers or larger ships with missiles while the B variant drops the missile launchers for more and heavier laser cannons to specialise in dogfighting enemy fighters. The C variant sacrifices the majority of its ability to engage fighters in return for an expanded capability to engage capital ships.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAI,The Raka is a Hutt freighter model that was commonly converted to act as a fighter support vessel to allow for pilots to rest and their craft to be refueled and rearmed while away from base or a capital ship. This allows the Hutts to send groups of starfighters and gunships far beyond their normal range to harass the enemy logistical routes with multirole fighters commonly selected for this duty such as the A variant of the modular Morningstar or some of the more openly available versions of the new Y-wing Starfighter which can engage any enemy target such as freighters, their escorting fighters, corvettes, or frigates. The ancient Mandalorian Kell Gunship can be used as a cheap gunship to bolster the survivability and firepower of these raiding task forces.  
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAJ,The Rendili StarDrive Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser was a near ubiquitous ship amongst planetary government defense fleets due to its cheap cost and ease of use. Because of this, it is extremely easy for Hutt Cartels to source these vessels to rapidly bolster their nascent naval presence although the vast majority of these vessels would be the relatively under-gunned variants that predate the outbreak of hostilities in The Clone Wars. Due to urgency at which the Hutts need mid sized capital hulls in service; the majority of DHCs deployed remain in this weaker state due to a lack of time to complete refits although to compensate for this lack, one DHC in every trio deployed is the massively upgunned Gunboat variant as a stopgap measure.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAK,While the undergunned “PDF” Dreadnaught Heavy Cruisers are being brought and rushed out as a stop gap measure, Hutt naval yards are busily producing their own licensed production version of the DHC which matches contemporary wartime standards in the Ubrikkian Cruiser as their standard mass produced mid sized warship. Observations of the fighter heavy nature of the Clone Wars led to the doctrinal development to frequently deploy these cruisers alongside the natively developed Tempest Cruiser which lacks some of the firepower of the Ubrikkian design but has a more versatile weapons loadout and the capability to carry and deploy their own starfighter squadrons. This well rounded standard formation aims to be a building block for the rapidly developing Hutt navy to operate around.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAL,Seeing the increasing reliance on small to midsized vessels in the naval forces of their potential rivals, the Hutts developed the Szajin cruiser which relies on lots of rapid firing lighter turbolasers to deal its damage which necessitates very aggressive tactics when these ships are deployed. Operating in trios they can cooperate to more effectively close into range with taking a minimum of damage. The well rounded Kossak operate in pairs in the wake of the Szajins to fend off enemy snubfighter squadrons or finish off crippled vessels.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAM,An ancient standard Hutt formation composed of centuries old designs, a pair of Karagga Destroyers escorted by a small swarm Barabbula frigates can output a prodigious amount of anti capital ship missiles nearly certain to pierce through any point defence grids of Hutt opponents while barrages of turbolasers swat away the ships crippled by the missiles. Formations like these represent the naval power of the ancient Hutts which have been kept hidden away for millennia and now re released upon the galaxy.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAN,As the Hutts start to remilitarise and look outwards once again, their need to operate further and further away from their long established bases increases. This forced the Hutts to expand their supply of militarised merchant vessels which can transport a reasonable amount of supplies while having some ability to defend themselves from enterprising pirate or hostile powers interdicting supply lines. To this end an upgunned version of the iconic Galleon is commonly used while the ancient Juvard frigate has found a new lease on life as a convoy escort vessel for when the Hutt Galleons are operating in areas of increased risk. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAO,The intensity of the starfighter combat between the CIS and Republic has led the Hutt Cartels to invest in modernising their starfighter fleet beyond cheap mass market models and a reliance on mercenary contractors. The Dunelizard fighter is one of these new developments that the resurgent Hutt Navy started to field to escort its older Kusak bombers on their strike runs. The Dunelizard’s slugthrowers could engage enemy fighters to clear approaches for the slow Kusak squadrons or the Dunelizard’s proton torps can assist engaging with larger ships if enemy fighter cover was lacking.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAP,The Scyk Fighter line is also a relatively new adoption into the Hutt Navy as a lightly armed fast interceptor used on mass to protect spaceborne assets or sweep the local area for any enemy squadrons. However the lack of firepower of the Scyk means that Hutt commanders often partner them with squadrons operating heavier fighters such as the Cloakshape; still used despite the Hutts attempts to switch to domestic production over open market imports due to its extreme versatility and availability.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAQ,Using converted Raka Freighters as fighter tenders, it is possible for the Hutts to send long range snubfighter and gunship raids deep behind enemy lines. A wide range of craft are often chosen for these operations althought there are a prefrence for those with multirole capablities over monotask designs to allow for the widest range of targets to be hit. Newer Krayt gunships can be sparingly found in these roles to boost the firepower of the formation alongside the older Kell gunships.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAR,Having seen the effectiveness of massed bombers in the engagements between the Republic and Cis, the Hutts experimented with a formation based around the expensive but well protected Scurrg heavy bomber. To ensure these valuable craft successfully made their attack runs it heavy gunships were assigned to be both their fighter escort and also provide supporting firepower against their capital ship targets. While this group of squadrons provides an disportionate amount of firepower to Hutt commanders, their deployments are limited due to the high cost of all the majority of the craft involved which heavily limits their aquistion and replacement.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAS,The Vontor is an extremely ancient design that has not been seen outside of the mysterious Bootana Hutta area of space for millennia. There the Hutts had conserved and concealed their true power until such a time the Hutts were truly threatened. With the outbreak of total galactic war due to the Clone Wars, the Hutts no longer feel safe exercising using only soft and criminal power. The Vontor provides the backbone of these newly released hidden fleets with the versatile Tempests providing support for the operations of the capital ships. Szajin Cruisers kept in reserve are sallied out to rapidly close down and exterminate ships decimated by the longer range firepower before returning the safety of the capital ships and their fighter cover.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAT,The heavy fighter variant of the Scyk was developed in response to opinions of the baseline fighter lacking enough firepower to be truely effective. These upgraded fighters are expected to be capable of providing fighter cover for the brand new Kimogila line of bombers. These new designs signal the Hutt’s shift away from a reliance on mercs and open market designs towards newer more capable models of fighters piloted by those recruited from the worlds under the sway of the Hutts.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAU,The Voracious is an extremely old Hutt design that has not been seen by the wider galaxy for millennia as they have been kept in reserve in Boonta Hutta in case the Hutts ever needed to restore its naval warfighting capabilities. Despite the design’s age and frailty, its cavernous hangar bays and long range heavy guns means it can still remain relevant as fleet support vessel. Swarms of Barabbula frigates are often attached to Voracious carriers to add their long range anti ship missiles to the carriers long range guns and keep any threatening ships at a distance. Vontor Destroyers are often assigned as a mutually supporting fleet element with Juvard frigates in tow. This element serves to keep the ancient and valuable carriers safe by interposing itself between them and any threat and also is capable of dealing with a wide range of threats even without the assistance of long range fire support and fighter sorties. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAV,The Dor’bulla is not just the largest warship fielded by the Hutts but it is also a statement of their wealth and power developed to safeguard Hutt space from the ever growing amount of battlecruiser sized ships developed in the prelude to the the Clone Wars. Despite its power and resilience, only foolish commanders operate such a valuable ship on its own. Karagga Destroyers can use the mass of the Dorbulla to shield themselves whilst barraging an enemy with wave after wave of ship-killing missiles. Fielding Szajin's forces an enemy to pick between the single giant threat or the group of small bundles of firepower in a cruiser hull, with Ubrikkian Cruisers operating as a balanced element able to provide their own firepower against enemy capital ships whilst providing decent laser fire to swat away enemy squadrons.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAW,The Ancient Hutts shied away from using open warfare with the realisation they could win a drawn out war of attrition against the short lived and faster reproducing races that composed the Old Republic and switched over to soft influence and criminal enterprises to maintain their place in the galaxy. With a return to a total war footing, the Hutts solved one element of their manpower problem by the conscription of their many client races to fill their manpower needs. Another method used was to pull all their criminal and mercenary contacts developed through millennia of careful patronage into a more centralised command structure allowing them to form flotillas and task forces from disparate groups that had used to operate on their own. This provides the Hutts a second massive pool of manpower which will constantly refill as long as Hutts are willing to invest the appropriate amount of credits.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAX,For millennia the Hutts have refuted open warfare as a viable form of wielding power for their species. For millennia the Hutts maintained the image of only interested in economic and criminal influence with the barest minimal applications of military force. For millennia the Hutts have been slowly preparing for the next outbreak of galactic war with ships slowly and covertly constructed for the Boonta Hutta fleets which locked down the secretive core of Hutt space. With no warfare for many generations of Hutts, development of new warships was a low priority and thus the vast majority of the vessels in the Boonta Hutta fleet are truly ancient designs which belay their true strength. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAY,With the Hutts now truly militarised and investing into their own military, they have moved away from cheap open market designs like the Z95 Headhunter in all but the lowest priority sectors. The new Dunelizard Interceptor became a popular replacement fighter for the Hutts for high priority sectors due to its mix of survivability, manoeuvrability and decent anti fighter firepower.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_JEDI_STRIKE_TEAM,The Jedi are the protectors of the Republic and have served the Republic in its times of need for millennia. These elite Force-sensitives often found themselves in the hardest of fights and the most important locations of the war. An organized company of Jedi Knights consists of members of the Guardian, Consular, and Sentinel schools, each offering a unique skillset to bring into battle.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_LIGHT_WALKER,With their low profile and high speed, AT-PTs were a popular choice to deploy in small packs to hunt for enemy infantry although their lack of heavy firepower left them exposed to any armoured counter attack. The rare but highly effective AT-XT walker can form a small protective core for its smaller walker cushion to retreat behind in the case of the AT-PTs pack finding a target it cannot deal with itself.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_AIR_ASSAULT_BRIGADE, LAATs are the iconic and extremely common Republic gunship/lander and are used for many different mission roles including commando team insertions and close air support for the landed troops. HAETs abandon the massive troop bay of the LAAT for better sensors and a large gun making them perfectly suited for air support and reconnaissance.  
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_ANTI_AIR_BATTERY,Dedicated Anti Air vehicles such as the UT-AA served an important role during battle in protecting ground troops from the numerous gunships of the Confederates like the dreaded HMP. AT-RTs provide a light escort from any infiltrating infantry which seek to destroy the vehicles or provide early warning of a larger attack. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_ARTILLERY,Not all military formations operate on the frontline. The AV7 provides indirect fire support for lots of Republic ground operations with their long range shells able to devastate unprepared formations from relative safety at the rear of Republic battle lines. AT-APs range further forward using their long range mass drivers as direct-fire artillery pieces in support of troops although they are also capable of dealing with attacks on themselves with their other weapons. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_CLONE_AIRLANDING,In many operations during the Clone wars, Republic forces had to make hostile landings to clear out a beachhead for more forces to deploy. To this end the Gunship/transport hybrid LAAT/i is capable of landing small forces of Clones equipped for assault operations and then supporting them in combat as they storm the target and prepare it for follow on formations. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_CLONE_COMPANY,The Clone Army forms the main element of the Grand Army of the Republic with Clone trooper formations being able to be rapidly redeployed to meet the ever changing demands of the war. Often led into battle by a Jedi, Clones serve as the main infantry of the Republic. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_CLONE_P2_COMPANY,The roll out of Phase 2 Clone Armour took a while to complete but the new armour saw a noticeable improvement in the capabilities of the regular clone trooper. It also coincided with an increase of individualism in the clones. More capable than the purely identical clones that started the Clone wars, Clones still were the mainstay infantry of the Republic and were frequently led into battle by a Jedi. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_COMBAT_AIR_PATROL,The fast and light Gaba-18 Airspeeder is frequently used to rapidly scout out the combat theatre. If a threat is too great for the light guns of the Gaba, heavier assets can be called in as needed. The extremely fast and relatively heavily armed Flashblind airspeeder is frequently able to rapidly respond to requests for additional firepower from the forward recon assets as well as protecting them from aerial interception. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_HEAVY_MECHANISED,The A5 juggernaut was a fast and complex heavy assault vehicle that used its high speed and heavy firepower to storm enemy positions before unloading squads of Republic clone troopers to flush out any remaining enemy and then secure the position.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_HEAVY_WALKER,The AT-TE walker was the mainstay assault walker of the Grand Army of the Republic that saw service from the very start of the war and saw service in nearly every major ground battle. It was frequently and best deployed alongside large groups of clones in mutual support of each other. The AT-OT is the inverse of the AT-TE, losing some of the weaponry and armour of the AT-TE but gaining a lot more room for cargo or passengers. When not deployed in a rear line logistical role, the AT-OT can transport a large amount of clones safely to the frontlines where they can dismount into combat.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_LIGHT_MECHANISED,The Juggernaut series of vehicles are intended for assaulting enemy formations and often did this while carrying their own escorting infantry in their large cargo bays. The heavy infantry carried by these large vehicles can either be used to bolster the considerable firepower of this family of assault vehicles or to hold the land taken by its charge from any counter attack.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_MANDO_MERCENARY,Not all forces that took part in the Clone Wars were associated with either major faction. Such times of strife allowed many groups to sell their services to the highest bidder. While the government of Mandalore may have remained officially neutral in the conflict, not all Mandalorians accepted this pacifism but sought to maintain their old warlike ways even if it meant fighting other’s wars. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_PATHFINDERS,The Phase 2 Armour program improved heavily on the original clone trooper armours in many regards. Perhaps most importantly for the ARC troopers was its ease of customizability giving them even more freedom to specialise for their mission. Alongside the effective Biker Advanced Recon Commando Speeder, these Advanced Reconnaissance Commandos are an elite and fast strike force.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_PDF_ASSAULT,Equipped with light weight rapid fire weapons, PDF assault squads are tasked with capturing enemy locations in close quarter battle or finishing off enemy formations pinned by the fire of line formations. The attached medic squad helps to keep the poor quality PDF soldiers alive. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_PDF_LINE,Expected only to protect Republic planets from low level threats or failing that, delaying the enemy until more forces of Grand Army of the Republic can be deployed; These PDF Squads are equipped with heavy weapons intended to provide a solid base of fire to pin enemy threats. Attached SD-6 infantry Hulk Droids provide some extra firepower and protection to the low quality PDF soldiers. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_RECON,Fast 74-Z Speeder bikes scout out the land in preparation for the enemy and to give information allowing following on formations to deploy in best fashion. AT RTs provide a core of firepower to help rescue any scouts that get heavily engaged.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_REPULSOR_ASSAULT,While walkers were a highly popular design choice for the Grand Army of the Republic, it was recognised that walkers could not fill every role and terrain type. Repulsorlift vehicles were often used in terrain not able to take the weight of the walkers. The UT AT provides heavy firepower for the more mobile Saber fighter tanks to operate around while the ISP run escort to protect the tanks from infantry attack. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_SPEARHEAD,The A6 Juggernaut is an even larger and stronger version of the A5 and one of the largest and strongest ground vehicles fielded during the Clone Wars by the Republic. Expensive and prone to breakdowns, it tended to only see service in the most important theatres of the war. An A6 alone is a mighty threat on the battlefield. An A6 flanked with several A5s could easily roll over all but the strongest position. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_SPECIAL_FORCES_TEAM,ARC troopers are the best of the best of Clone troopers but are extremely small in numbers. Clone Commandos are a midpoint between the one man army ARCs and the regular Clone troopers but are still formidable in their combat ability. Working together ARCs and Commandos make for an extremely formidable force capable of devastating surgical strikes. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAA,The Delta 6 was a short ranged and stripped down interceptor designed for usage by the Jedi Order whose force powers could make best use of light weight design and negate its weaknesses. This stripped down nature made it extraordinarily cheap which also made it a popular acquisition for several Planetary Defence Forces even if normal pilots struggled to make best use of its design. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAB,The V-19 was a fighter design rushed into service at the start of the Clone Wars to provide a standard fighter for Clone Pilots. Jedi were also pressed into military service during the Clone Wars where they often preferred to lead their force’s fighters from the front while piloting their Delta 7 fighters
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAC,While the clones were the most visible aspect of Republic Military Forces, the vast majority were non clones. Fighter groups formed from the Planetary Defence Forces and then rotated to active duty into the Republic Navy were common. The Z95 Headhunter was a popular choice for PDF groups due to their versatility, low cost for their performance, and high availability. Headhunters converted into bombers provide the Strike Wing with a lot more firepower against larger targets while more standard Headhunters seek out hostile fighters.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAD,One of the few fighters commonly used by the Republic which had an inbuilt hyperdrive, the Aggressive Reconnaissance Starfighter 170 was intended to reach behind enemy lines to rapidly strike and destroy vulnerable facilities. To do this the ARC had strong lasers and proton torpedoes to rapidly deal damage while a manned turret compensated for the slower speed and lower agility of the design. In addition to its intended role the ARC170 was also used by the Republic as a heavy fighter in traditional battle. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAE,Y wings were the primary bomber used by the Starfighter pilots in the Republic Navy. Despite being heavily armoured and possessing a defence turret, they were not trusted to go into combat alone against any target possessing decent fighter coverage unless there were no available fighters to escort them which could often happen due to the Y wing possessing a hyperdrive while most Republic fighters lacked one. As the standard fighter for the early war Republic, the V-19s often were tasked with such escort even when more modern fighters started to appear for the Republic as the war progressed. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAF,The CIS employed massed fighter tactics in nearly all its battles which prompted the Republic to employ lots of its smaller ships in anti fighter roles such to provide a protective picket for the larger vessels. CR90s and LACs were commonly employed in such roles due to their modularity which allowed for easy conversions of weapons loadouts.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAG,Carracks served in many Planetary Defence Forces before the Clone Wars started which meant that when the war started large numbers of them were available to be folded into the Republic Navy. In war time service they were often formed into wolf packs where their concentrated heavy turbolasers fire could be devastating for ships much larger than themselves. While their own lasers provided some defence against the swarms of CIS fighters, some commanders provided fighter cover launched from the old Class-C frigate which can also provide more protection against smaller vessels. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAH,Small groups of fast multipurpose frigates were frequently kept in reserve by commanders to act as small-scale rapid reaction task forces for when patrolling elements encountered hostile enemies, or to quickly reinforce larger ships which were engaged in battle. Both the Victory 1 Frigate and Arquitens possess the speed needed for this role along with the versatile array of weaponry to reasonably engage any enemy forces they are called to face.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAI,As the war progressed the Republic found it necessary to bolster local PDF forces which were under threat from the CIS or the rising pirate threat. T.I.E Starfighters were a relatively cheap but capable fighter that was also easy for pilots to fly. This resulted in the Republic purchasing large quantities of the fighter not old to fill up hangar capacity of older less prioritised warships but also to aid the defences of loyal planets. Despite never being in the limelight like other Clone Wars fighters, the growing numbers of T.I.Es along with their effectiveness would help influence the decisions of the later Empire to base their fighters on the design's successor.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAJ,As the Clone Wars progressed, more and more planets decided to take their local defences more seriously. As a result many of them sought to increase the quantity and quality of their starfighter forces as many of them had relied on cheap, good enough fighters. Unable to simply replace all their fighters in an instant, many used squadrons of better quality fighters to bolster a wing of cheaper fighters where it could act as a centre point of the formation. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAK,The quality of fighters and bombers possessed by a Planetary Defence Force could vary wildly. While some only had token defensive forces which would likely not resist any determined threat, other planets took their own defence more seriously and sought out better quality forces which could actually hurt any attacker. Despite their unpopularity in the Republic Navy, The H60 Tempest would find its way into the service of such planets as a capable bomber was far better than no bomber craft at all. The ever reliable Cloakshape was a popular choice for planets as it was easily available and highly customisable to match their needs such as escorting the bombers to their target. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAL,Large numbers of corvettes would be produced during the Clone Wars as these small but capable vessels were able to be built in vast numbers compared to the larger warships which gave the Republic the ability to disperse them for the regular duties of war such as patrols and escorts. However at times large numbers of corvettes could be concentrated into a single spot which represents a deceptively high amount of firepower. Such wolf packs of corvettes are a lethal threat to any vessel if injured or otherwise deceptive and their speed and small size allows them to rapidly relocate during the battle to take advantage of any such opportunities. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAM,The venerable Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser was a near ubiquitous warship across the Republic, both in the Republic Navy and Planetary Defence Forces. The ones frequently found in the service of PDFs were often of lower quality and lacking in the weaponry compared to their Naval cousins, although planets did take modernisation programs during the war to rectify this deficit such as by converting the unused spaces in their Dreadnaughts into hangar bays which could then be used to carry fighters and bombers. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAN,Designed as a troop transport for the Republic’s secret Clone Army, the Acclamator was built on mass and was rapidly forced into other roles especially early in the war where other warships were not available to the Republic Navy in any suitable numbers. Thus the Acclamator became a warship with multiple variants where it could serve in roles such as a backline carrier or frontline brawler. Battle groups of Acclamators could be found through the duration of the Clone Wars in reflection of the capability and versatility their design proved to have. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAO,Both designs were often used for long-duration patrol and assault missions, the contradictory weapon loadouts and combat characteristics of the block-1 Imperial and Gladiator series frigates work well together. Each provides different firepower and support while being relatively fast vessels, allowing them to engage near any target type when covering the other’s weakness.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAP,The Dreadnaught Heavy Cruisers which ended up in the service of the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars were often far better armed and of a better quality in general then the ones remaining in the service of the Planetary Defence Forces. The massive amounts of DHCs made in the decades preceding the Clone Wars resulted in them being the backbone warships of the Republic, especially in the early periods of the war where newer designs were only just starting to be designed or enter service. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAQ,The V-wing became the premier fighter in the service of the Republic during the last year of the war where swarms of the highly capable fighter were sent to destroy any and all fighters sent out by the CIS. The Jedi largely maintained their early war habit of leading from the front in their fighters although their Delta 7 was largely replaced by the highly advanced Eta-2 Actis by this period of the war. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAR,The NTB-630 found life as a heavy bomber for the Republic during the Clone Wars where it was extensively used to bring large amounts of ordinance on CIS targets. The Z-95 was also adopted by the Republic and received extensive modifications into a highly deadly fighter that could be used either to escort the heavy bombers to their target or join them in their attack runs with their own proton torpedoes. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAS,As the Clone Wars progressed, the Republic's tactics adapted as the need for anti-fighter protection from corvettes decreased due to the vast increase in the number and capability of Republic fighters. Furthermore the CIS often attempted to hunt down these corvettes with their own small vessels. This reduced the size of the Republic picket groups along with resulting in less specialised corvettes being dedicated to the task force to provide protection against CIS raiders. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAT,As the Class-C frigate fell out of favour and was seen in fewer numbers their role as support for Carrack Wolf Packs had to be replaced with a frigate that existed in greater numbers. The mass produced Pelta Assault variant fell into this role as although it lacked a hangar, it had sufficient lasers and point defence systems which allowed it to provide anti fighter protection for the carracks along with battling smaller corvettes which challenged the task force.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAU,Gunships were a popular choice for Planetary Defence Forces which require a cheap long range defence option. Skiprays were a durable platform which combined a large array of weapons which allowed it to engage any threat found while the Citadel focused mainly on combating the CIS fighters. Together, squadrons of these Gunships were able to go on long range missions from their base and engage any threat encountered or survive long enough to call in reinforcements. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAV,One of the main weaknesses of the standard Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser Line was their weakness to CIS fighters and bombers due to the lack of their own hangars and laser weaponry. Thus in order to rectify this weakness in the standard formation, carrier conversion of the PDF DHCs were requisitioned to supplement the cruiser line with some fighter cover and some bombers to project power further out from the formation. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAW,Neutron Stars were freighters rapidly converted into warships in order to fulfil the massively increased demand for convoy escorts which resulted from the Clone Wars. When needed they could also transport their own supplies in addition to being the escorts for other logistical vessels such as the Pelta, another wartime design frequently used to transfer people and supplies to the frontline. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAX,The Victory Fleet was the first and main republic Fleet to get the new Victory Class Star Destroyers alongside the Gladiator Star Destroyer which had been specifically designed to escort the Victory. The Fleet was primarily broken up into two main task forces although even smaller sub formations would be detached where needed. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAY,The Venator Star Destroyer was the backbone capital ship of the Republic Navy due to its versatile nature, large capacity for ground units or fighters, and no obvious weaknesses. This versatility also made the Venator an ideal core for task forces as it could cover all possible threats with one design while just adding more ships to increase the fleet strength. Groups of Venators often made the spearhead of Republic invasion fleets to clear local space of enemies while Acclamators followed in their wake to deliver more ground troops. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAZ,The Victory Star Destroyer packed an impressive array of weapons and ordnance but did suffer from a lack of speed which could allow for enemy forces to disengage and flee. The Acclamator II transforms the once troop carrier into a rapid and deadly vessel which can saturate ships or planets in turbolaser fire. When paired with the slow Victory the relatively nimble Acclamators could chase down and finish wounded prey. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ABA,Designed during the Clone wars but suffered from issues during their introduction, The Imperator Star Destroyer and its sister design the Tector Star Destroyer saw limited service in the war. Both were designed to dominate the fleets of the CIS with the Imperator being extremely well rounded while the Tector lost a lot of that versatility in order to be better against the large numbers of cruisers and frigates fielded by the Republic’s Enemies. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ABB,The Invincible was a relic of a warship by the time of the Clone Wars but still remained in service due to successive waves of modernisations on the design. By the time of the war it was largely dependent on its deep reserves of concussion missiles to deal with enemies alongside a large array of anti fighter weapons. Victory Star Destroyers escorted by Gladiator Star Destroyers could add their own considerable barrage of missiles to further overwhelm any defences of the enemy and thus ensuring enough missiles arrive on target with destructive results.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ABC,The Republic made heavy use of carrier warships during the Clone Wars as a direct counter to the droid swarm fighters of the CIS. As the war progressed this eventually resulted in the Republic being able to gain local fighter superiority wherever they focused their industrial and military might. Led by the rare Secutor Star Destroyer, large numbers of Venators and Acclamators could deploy an overwhelming swarm of high quality fighters to gain control of any battle space, followed up by waves of bombers and long range turbolaser fire to eradicate any large vessel in the area. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ABD,Republic naval doctrine underwent a shift over the course of The Clone Wars, the navy began to move away from a reliance on carriers in favour of more direct firepower. The Praetor-I was still unmatched in its class, and the improved Victory II Star Destroyer proved valuable in stripping enemy shields. The new Imperator Star Destroyer was grouped with them to bridge the gap and provide some fighter support.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ABE,The Republic needed significant firepower and significant fight and bomber reserves in order to overcome the most defensible Confederate worlds and their defence forces. The Praetor-I Battlecruiser was an obvious choice, and in order to provide self-sufficient carrier support, the Secutor class was assigned to accompany the Praetor into hostile space.

TEXT_UPGRADE_CIS_SECRET_HYPERSPACE_ROUTE,Secret Hyperspace Route
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_CIS_DESIGN_TRADE_OFFS,A sad reality is that many of our ship designs were meant for private security operations for corporations. Now they are being used for conventional warfare some issues have been found in their designs and we are not able to fix all of them. Given our production capabilities it might be more effective to sacrifice the survivability of our ships to increase their firepower and speed. This allows for better swarming of the Republic forces.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_CIS_SECRET_HYPERSPACE_ROUTE,Not all who support our cause do so openly but some remain embedded in the society and government systems of the Republic. One of these anonymous benefactors is willing to divulge to us a seemingly forgotten hyperspace route in return for a generous donation. This route would allow us to bring in unexpected reinforcements from an unengaged taskforce. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_HUTT_CARTELS_BOOTANA_HUTTA_REINFORCEMENT,In the ancient past the Hutts used to be the overlords of an expansionist Empire but the devastation of many wars such as the Xim Wars and the later Hutt Cataclysm caused the Hutts to change their philosophy away from wars of conquests with slave armies towards soft power and subversion of others. While the contemporary Hutts outwardly seem relatively peaceful and passive, the Hutts still maintain a secret military on the Core Worlds with the Bootana Hutta Fleet being a strong mobile force ready to crush any unwanted attention aimed at their Core Worlds. If the Hutts ever decide to “wake up” and return to the aggression of old, this fleet could also form the core of a revitalised Hutt Navy.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_HUTT_CARTELS_PROFIT_MOTIVE,The Hutts are always mindful to find ways to defend or even increase their power and the Hutts have developed a preference to leveraging their economic strength instead of more mindless destructive displays of strength. Overseers squeeze out every inch of profit possible from the economic endeavours under their control while Commanders are careful with the deployment of military forces in order to conserve their strength over the long run to avoid the anger of their Hutt lords at any undue losses and the costs thus incurred in their replacement.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ACE_CLONING_PROGRAM,While Jango Fett is the best known clone template, the Republic cloned many other skilled people to meet the needs of its army in the hope that the clones would inherit the abilities and talents of their templates. Secure the allocation of elite clone pilot templates to help clear the area of droids.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_PDF_FLEETS,Before the cowardly and treasonous surprise attack of the CIS, the Republic had no need of its own navy or army. Instead planets were responsible for their own defences. If needed we can draw on these planetary defence fleets of loyal Republic worlds to bolster our forces although it will mean diverting funds temporarily to their local government. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_SECRET_FLEETS,During the course of the war, the Supreme Chancellor channelled money into several black projects. One of those projects was the construction of multiple secret fleets to be deployed at the final moments of the war to secure a victory. While it will temporarily hurt our economy, the surprise arrival of a battle fleet would surely help us gain a rapid victory before the enemy can recover.
