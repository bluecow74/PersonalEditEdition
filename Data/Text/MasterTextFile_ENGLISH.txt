TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_03,   Random Enemy Location lets you pick your planet and will procedurally generate the enemies you leave in the orbit of your starting planet several jumps away.
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_04,   Pick Enemy Location will procedurally generate enemies around the planet where you leave their dummy, unless you sell the dummy or leave in above your starting planet. 
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_05,   Pick everywhere spawns a large set of dummies for each faction (including your own) with your starter. When you choose your starting planet, each planet with a faction dummy over it will be given to that facton. Planets that also have a capital dummy will spawn the faction capital, have extra starting forces, and add extra starting credits if the faction already has a capital.
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_06,- Standard Roster will leave the starting roster for your faction and era unchanged. Roster Additions will spawn additional units from other eras, research, government mechanics, GC specific units, etc. that can be built. If these are positioned over your starting planet, they will be enabled. Custom Roster will also spawn the default roster and disable units if they are not over your starting planet. Mapped Roster allows you to define units from outside your faction to replace roster units when built. 2 copies of a base unit, a mapping dummy, and a stack of rough equivalent units will spawn on different planets. Leave only one equivalent unit on the same planet as a mapping dummy to select it, or move a random map dummy to select a random choice from all units with the mapping dummy when you build the base unit. Random Roster will enable a random selection of all custom roster units. Random Map will generate a mapped roster with each base unit mapped to a random choice. Lootbox Roster a will generate a mapped roster that allows any mappable unit to be rolled when a unit is built.
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_07,- Default heroes will spawn a fixed set from standard libraries. Pick Heroes will spawn a large set of heroes of which up to 20 can be kept from if they are placed with the starter dummy. Random Heroes will automatically select a collection from the same hero options. For Pick and Random, Factional will limit you to heroes associated with your faction, Universal will work with all heroes in the mod.
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_08,- From the Ground Up gives the player a single planet and AI factions either 4 connected planets or a set of 3 and 2 connected planets. Small start will give each faction connected 6 planets and a small set of starting heroes. Full start will divide almost the whole map among the factions (e.g, appromimately one third of the galaxy for each of three factions) and spawn the same heroes as a progressive map at this era.
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_09,   Any leftover planets will be given to Independent Forces. The player faction can use a modifier for a smaller or larger territory (e.g. half with one enemy to split the galaxy into one third and two third, single planet on small start to play FTGU with heroes). In pick everywhere, these choices only affect the hero spawns.
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_10,- For advanced users, these scripts are not dependent on map layout. There is a utility in Data\XML\Conquests\Custom that can copy the layout of any map in EaWX to one of the Custom campaigns. The starting planet will be randomized if the defaults are not present.

Some are random missions, some are government related plot events, and some are other kinds of events or missions.

See the ingame influence guide for ways to increase influence on your planets and prevent or reduce unrest.

TEXT_ENCYCLOPEDIA_GROUNDWAR_TUTORIAL,Instead of the homogeneous units of the GC, Units are often mixes of several squads and vehicles that arrive by a self-destructing spawner. This means that there is no population capacity in this game mod so battles can get large. In this mode the economy is derived from a steady flow from the command centre and then two bunkers buildable on the landing points. The economic bunker is weaker but gives more income. Landing zones can also be targeted and destroyed rather than having to push in and attempting to capture them whilst the enemy is landing on your head.

This faction (dark red, also indicated with the Republic's galactic roundel next to their planets) will not attack you, and will only defend their own territory. Increasing your senate support via missions will cause one of these planets to join you. Attacking them may result in negative consequences.

TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_ACTIVATE_KOTOR,Bastila Shan: Revan was heavily injured, but I've preserved their life. The Jedi do not execute prisoners, but the Council may heal Revan's wounded mind so they can atone for their actions.

TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_NO_MASTER_WARNING,None dare claim Mastery of the Sith. The Order of the Sith Lords lies dormant, for now...
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_BANDON,Darth Bandon: My apprentice was a fool to challenge me.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_BASTILA_SITH,Bastila Shan: Weakling! I'll rend your flesh for this pathetic rebellion. I hope your replacement will prove more competent.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_GLOVOC,Darth Glovoc: The plots of my underlings spin as futilely as the fire rings of Fornax, baubles of wrath that fail to scorch the object of their purpose.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_JORAK_ULN,Jorak Uln: What?! Mutiny! Behave, student! I'll... that's it! Detention for you! Permanent detention!!
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_KALATOSH_ZAVROS,Kalatosh Zavros: A Sith after my own heart. Pity, we would have done great things together.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_MALAK,Darth Malak: Such ambition, but without the strength to back it up. Perhaps my next apprentice will be more promising.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_NIHILUS,Darth Nihilus: [Ravenous screams]
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_REVAN_SITH,Darth Revan: The apprentice has learned their final lesson.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_SION,Darth Sion: I will remake you. So when I look upon you it shall be like a mirror. Then I shall let you die.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_TRAYA,Darth Traya: My overeager apprentice's treachery was no match for the Lord of Betrayal. I now seek a new and wiser student.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_UTHAR_WYNN,Uthar Wynn: You have become too ambitious, apprentice. It is time for you to die and someone more... talented... to take your place.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_VOREN_RENSTAAL,Darth Voren: You may have matched my own ambition, but I refuse to let go of what I fought for so easily. Now, perish!
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_YUTHURA,Yuthura Ban: There's no such thing as friends among the Sith. It's time for you to die.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_SYSTEM,The Sith leadership is composed of powerful force users, at the master, apprentice, and acolyte level. Typically one Master, one Apprentice, and two Acolytes. If any are killed, a new one may be chosen from the available pool. As time goes on, the apprentice's ambition also grows, and a leader has to be chosen between the Master and Apprentice, killing the loser.

TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_BASTILA_SITH,Bastila Shan: I learned much from you, but I'm afraid I have no need of you now. Is it not our way for the apprentice to surpass the master?
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_GLOVOC,Darth Glovoc: I have seen the trammels that shall bind the galaxy utterly. Trammels I saw myself place, that I shall lay down as my visions bid.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_JORAK_ULN,Jorak Uln: You were a fool to let down your guard, and what kind of Sith would I be if I didn't grab fate by the nose hairs? Ha ha!
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_KALATOSH_ZAVROS,Kalatosh Zavros: You still haven't come to terms with the wickedness of your ways, master? So be it. You will die.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_MALAK,Darth Malak: The strongest must rule this galaxy, and you are far too weak to rule any longer. The Sith throne is mine!
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_NIHILUS,Darth Nihilus: [Distorted howls of hunger]
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_REVAN_SITH,Darth Revan: I am the Lord of the Sith! Bow down before me!
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_SION,Darth Sion: To not seize power when it lies before you is weakness. The chance to heal this fractured galaxy, to make it strong, now lies with me.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_TRAYA,Darth Traya: It can be a quiet thing, for the tide of history to turn upon one who was so strong. But now it is I who holds the galaxy by its throat.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_UTHAR_WYNN,Uthar Wynn: To stand still is to know death... one must always be moving forward. So is it the same amongst the Sith. Compete or die.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_VOREN_RENSTAAL,Darth Voren: Where once I was merely the learner, now I am the master. Neither Jedi nor Sith shall stand above me again!
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_YUTHURA,Yuthura Ban: Do you hear that, my master? That is the sound of a new leader rising to replace you.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TRAYA_APPROACH,Darth Traya: Even now, events spiral towards destruction, though something may yet be done if you will simply listen, and understand. Revan knew this better than anyone. I shall wait until you choose to follow this path. When you are ready you have but to ask, and I will answer.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TRIUMVIRATE_END_NIHILUS_AND_SION,Darth Sion: No longer shall we be constrained by teachings that weaken us. Your rule is at an end, master. And with it the end of the Jedi is at hand.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TRIUMVIRATE_END_TRAYA,Darth Traya: You've failed to learn the lesson I sought to teach - that your strength is as meaningless as the strength of my hand. I have no need for such broken tools any longer.

TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETENEMY_PDF_SPEECH_02,Local Governor:  Our proud nation is in your debt. We will begin draftings as soon as we are ready and help defeat the remains of these corrupt oppressors wherever they strike again.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETENEMY_PDF_SPEECH_03,Local Governor:  And you call yourself a defender of freedom... We can only hope the war will be won one day. But if that happens, it won't be because of people like you.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETENEMY_REP_SPEECH_01,Republic Security Officer:  It has come to our attention that this planet has become increasingly dissatisfied with its current leaders. Send forces to prop up a new regime that is loyal to the Republic.

TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETENEMY_REP_SPEECH_03,Republic Security Officer:  We are most displeased with your failure, Commander. The Republic has no choice but to deny your additional units.

TEXT_MISSION_BESPIN_BREAKDOWN_02_INTRO_01,Skywalker: I noticed some abandoned droid factories on the way in. They must have been left intact when the Separatists fled, but I bet we can still find working droids in the remains...
TEXT_MISSION_BESPIN_BREAKDOWN_02_INTRO_02,Halcyon: An unorthodox strategy, but perhaps one that will serve us well.

TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_13,Vandar:  We trusted our instincts, but no one can always be right. The lesson is to learn from our mistakes.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_14,Dorak:  And we will-- Are the younglings secured?
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_15,Vandar:  The last ones have just been smuggled off-world by Knight Carrick. Regardless of what happens tonight, the Order will survive.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_16,Mandalore the Ultimate:  So this is Coruscant, the city of lights... 
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_17,I know whoever gave this world that title didn't imagine those lights as flames, but I like it better this way. -- Hah!
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_18,Mandalore the Ultimate:  All forces, advance towards that power generator! It is the last line of defence for their Jedi Temple.

TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_02,Mandalore the Ultimate:  Are you the one they call Warden of the Pride, beast?
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_03,Warden of the Pride:  If you do not come in good faith, leave. Your presence
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_04,is a disgrace to my forebearers who gave their lives purging the galaxy of your kind.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_05,Mandalore the Ultimate:  Your spirit is amusing.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_06,Hear my words, animal! I have a message for your people.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_07,Years ago your kin repelled the assaults of my predecessor.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_08,You proved your worth in battle and showed the galaxy that any ordinary force will break at your shores.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_09,Unfortunately for you, I am no ordinary force. And I do not intent to fail where the last Mand'alor did.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_10,Warden of the Pride:  Is that so? Then I will give you the same words my father spoke to the same
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_11,Mandalore before his armies tried and failed.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_12,Bring forth your best warriors. One at a time or all in a rush. It does not matter.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_13,We claim this threshold as our own, and no being will pass it without finding their death through our hands.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_14,Cassus Fett:  Our boss wants us to level everything here. Prisoners are optional.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_15,Cassus Fett:  The warriors are dead. Round up the rest.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_16,Mandalorian Woman:  CASSUS-- Wait! They're defeated! We don't have to do this!
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_17,Cassus Fett:  The Cathar left a stain of dishonor on the Mando'ade. Today, I wash it clean in the water of their own presumption.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_18,But if you truly feel they need a defender to stand with them -- then do so, warrior. I salute you, Ke'serim!

TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_02_ALT_02,...Chief Representative, how would you describe the situation here?
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_03,...Refugees who have not only lost their homes but also everything they ever loved and cared about...
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_03_ALT_01,Every single day, millions of people are coming through this system,...

TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_04_ALT_02,The Senate Action Subcommittee has promised us ships and resources to handle the refugees, but nothing!
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_05,No one chose to watch their homes turn to ashes... But can the Core bring the saving grace they need?
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_05_ALT_01,How long does this have to continue, I ask?  How many more have to die until they see the truth?
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_05_ALT_02,...Meanwhile, unimportant Rim planets like Iseno get prioritised?  Where is the justice in this?

TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_08,General Grievous:  Citizens of Duro!  This is General Grievous of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_09,I am hereby addressing Chief Representative Officer Hoolidan Keggle.
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_10,This is your one chance to surrender. Lower the planetary shields, or watch your cities burn!
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_11,Hoolidan Keggle:  Never, Duro will not bow to off-worlders!

TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_13,General Grievous:  Our primary objective is to disable Jyvus Space City.
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_14,Hoolidan Keggle:  We need to protect the evacuating ships and give them as much time as possible!
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_15,General Grievous:  The station is disabled. Defeat what remains of the defending fleet, while my troops prepare to board Jyvus City!
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DEFENCE_SPEECH_16,Hoolidan Keggle:  The last convoy just escaped the system. Good work!

TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DRAMA_SPEECH_02,We are cornered. The Separatists are landing as I speak, and we cannot expect reinforcements with the blockade in orbit.
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DRAMA_SPEECH_03,I will not offer you false hope, only the truth. I have no intention of letting droid scum take my planet.
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DRAMA_SPEECH_04,If you stand and fight, we will show even steel shall bleed before our resolve.
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DRAMA_SPEECH_05,For Duro, and for the Republic, this is where the line is drawn!
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DRAMA_SPEECH_06,General Grievous: It's over Chief Representative, and Duro lies in ruins. Now for your surrender?
TEXT_MISSION_DURO_DRAMA_SPEECH_07,Hoolidan Keggle: Droid scum; Duro will never surrender while I live!

TEXT_MISSION_DUROS_DOOM_SPEECH_07,From one leader to another, I ask that you send everything you can muster to us

TEXT_MISSION_DUROS_DOOM_SPEECH_16,Cassus Fett:  Why bother? There shall be no prisoners or slaves today. There shall be only fire and blood.
TEXT_MISSION_DUROS_DOOM_SPEECH_17,Order all forces to attack as they wish, but make sure that the remains of the stations rain down on the planet.
TEXT_MISSION_DUROS_DOOM_SPEECH_18,Let their shattered cities serve as their graves.
TEXT_MISSION_DUROS_DOOM_SPEECH_19,Mandalorian Officer:  Sir, something is leaving hyperspace. It's a Republic fleet!
TEXT_MISSION_DUROS_DOOM_SPEECH_20,Cassus Fett:  So the Republic has decided to defend the planet after all. Very well, more targets for our troops.
TEXT_MISSION_DUROS_DOOM_SPEECH_21,The Revanchist:  Form a protection line between the Mandalorians and the space cities. We will crush Cassus' fleet.

TEXT_MISSION_ENTERING_ENCLAVE_SPEECH_03,Colonel Joisten:  No sir. Both Phaeda and Coruscant are still ignoring our hails ever since Halthor fell.
TEXT_MISSION_ENTERING_ENCLAVE_SPEECH_04,Zhar Lestin:  Who is it then, soldier?
TEXT_MISSION_ENTERING_ENCLAVE_SPEECH_05,Colonel Joisten:  The defence force commander, sir. They intercepted an Axehead trying to breach the perimeter.
TEXT_MISSION_ENTERING_ENCLAVE_SPEECH_06,The ship's being helmed by a certain Dorjander Kace who is requesting to speak with you immediately.
TEXT_MISSION_ENTERING_ENCLAVE_SPEECH_07,Zhar Lestin:  Very sorry the local defence squadron intercepted you, Master Kace.
TEXT_MISSION_ENTERING_ENCLAVE_SPEECH_08,-- But we weren't expecting you on Dantooine. Our communications with Phaeda and the Core are down.
TEXT_MISSION_ENTERING_ENCLAVE_SPEECH_09,Dorjander Kace:  That's why the Republic sent us to you, Zhar. They know many of your teachers are away
TEXT_MISSION_ENTERING_ENCLAVE_SPEECH_10,so a larger military presence will prevent Mandalorian meschief until the comm problem is sorted out.
TEXT_MISSION_ENTERING_ENCLAVE_SPEECH_11,Zhar Lestin:  Very wise. No one will interfere with your approach. Zhar Lestin out.

TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_SPEECH_10,They've been given their chance. Negotiations aren't my forte anyway. All ships, bring down the shipyards!
TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_SPEECH_11,Domb Treetor: The situation is untenable; Foreman Tambor must be informed of this treachery. To any engineers still in orbit, retreat to the planet's surface with any material wealth and shipyard equipment you can take with you.

TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_MANDO_SPEECH_06,If any assault on this monstrosity wants to be successful, we need to destroy these relays first.

TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_REP_SPEECH_04,Admiral Dodonna:  According to Onasi's intel, we need to destroy the station or the Republic is doomed.
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_REP_SPEECH_05,Admiral Dodonna:  It seems the stations scattered around the system act as energy relays do direct power from the sun.
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_REP_SPEECH_06,If any assault on this monstrosity wants to be successful, we need to destroy these relays first.
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_REP_SPEECH_07,Republic Officer:  More and more enemy ships are entering the battle.  We need to destroy the remaining relays to prevent the Star Forge from replacing its losses!
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_REP_SPEECH_08,Vandar:  I have send multiple small Jedi strike teams in shuttles to your location.
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_REP_SPEECH_09,Escort them to the Star Forge, they will try to sabotage it from the inside.
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_REP_SPEECH_10,Admiral Dodonna:  The death of their fleet commander will throw the enemy into disarray. Good work.
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_REP_SPEECH_11,Admiral Dodonna:  Good work, commander. If we continue like this, we might have a chance winning this war afterall.
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_REP_SPEECH_12,Admiral Dodonna:  This is the last one. Move the ship into attack range of the Star Forge. This will end now.
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_REP_SPEECH_13,Republic Officer:  All remaining forces retreat! The Sith fleet is too powerful!
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_REP_SPEECH_14,Republic Officer:  More Sith forces have entered the system!
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_SITH_SPEECH_01,Admiral Varko:  We are just in time. The Star Forge reports multiple Republic fleets entering the system.
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_SITH_SPEECH_02,Spread out and form a defence belt. Don't let any enemy ship near the Star Forge, do you copy?
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_SITH_SPEECH_03,Sith Officer:  Sir, it seems the enemy ships are attacking the energy relays scattered around the system.
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_SITH_SPEECH_04,Admiral Varko:  Engage at once!  We can't afford to lose any of them.
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_SITH_SPEECH_05,The Star Forge relies on these relays to collect the sun's energy to produce warships. Losing them will set back our war effort drastically!
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_SITH_SPEECH_06,Admiral Varko:  We're picking up multiple smaller ships leaving the enemy hangars. They are trying to board to the Star Forge. See to their destruction at once!
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_SITH_SPEECH_07,Admiral Varko:  Some boarding crafts have breached the blockade and entered the Star Forge. The Darth will take care of them.
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_SITH_SPEECH_08,Admiral Varko:  We can't afford to lose another relays! Do your job better!
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_SITH_SPEECH_09,Admiral Varko:  We're doomed...
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_SITH_SPEECH_10,Admiral Varko:  The death of their fleet commander will throw the enemy into disarray. Good work.
TEXT_MISSION_FORGING_FOES_SITH_SPEECH_11,Sith Officer:  All forces retreat! The Star Forge is lost.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_01,Headmaster:  I am the king before whom emperors bow. These were the words spoken by the faceless mask.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_02,               I know him. I know his kin. I have heard of the many guises his kind has taken:
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_03,The Chagrians of Champala know him as Aram Acheron; The inhabitants of Iego as Drol Rhamnus; 
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_04,the Rakata call him Nemesis;      And yet most call him the Great Other.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_05,Barsen'thor:  Enough. Ever since you've found this holocron in the catacombs, these walls..    These stones have poisoned your mind, old friend.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_06,               When did Azaël, Keeper of the Flame of Samûnaru, give up reason for madness?
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_07,Headmaster:  Only a fool calls powers beyond their grasp mad!  What I saw is reality!
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_08,               Beings made of light, who could be everywhere and nowhere at once. Vaster than nebulae and tinier than cells!
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_09,They assembled solar systems like children with toys.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_10,I saw birth and death of planets through hands yet to be born. Indescribable powers that are yet to be unleashed.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_11,All of that shrinks to nothing next to .. him.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_12,The Great Other is the One Who Remains. The force that disrupts the balance. Only she can stop him!
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_13,Barsen'thor:  I refused to help our brothers and sisters in their war and defended your decisions.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_14,               I should have abdicated your ways long ago. Whatever you plan, this ends now!

TEXT_MISSION_GIANTS_GRAVEYARD_SPEECH_06,Bail Organa:  What is this place?
TEXT_MISSION_GIANTS_GRAVEYARD_SPEECH_07,Anakin Skywalker:  Boz Pity... I read it's some sort of graveyard planet. But the size of the memorials...
TEXT_MISSION_GIANTS_GRAVEYARD_SPEECH_08,Obi-Wan Kenobi: The people of this system were giants. We think.
TEXT_MISSION_GIANTS_GRAVEYARD_SPEECH_09,Mace Windu:  The concentration of separatist forces suggests more than just Commander Ventress. If we can capture the confederacy leadership we might be able to end this war.
TEXT_MISSION_GIANTS_GRAVEYARD_SPEECH_10,Count Dooku:  Locate Grievous and Ventress, if they still live. Kill any clones you encounter, but leave the Jedi to me.
TEXT_MISSION_GIANTS_GRAVEYARD_SPEECH_11,Obi-Wan Kenobi:  We rooted the Confederacy here but it doesn't feel like a victory.
TEXT_MISSION_GIANTS_GRAVEYARD_SPEECH_12,Mace Windu:  In any war, the only decisive battle is the last one.
TEXT_MISSION_GIANTS_GRAVEYARD_SPEECH_13,Count Dooku:  A pathetic display by the Jedi... Even if they managed to retreat the planet.

TEXT_MISSION_GRIEVOUS_GAMBIT_SPEECH_11,
TEXT_MISSION_GRIEVOUS_GAMBIT_SPEECH_12,OOM-107: Sir, Republic reinforcements! They appear to have a new series of capital ships.

TEXT_MISSION_GUNNING_GUNRAY_SPEECH_01,Asajj Ventress:  Our informant has confirmed that Nute Gunray is being held captive on-board this vessel. We need to either destroy or board the ship to prevent him from exposing vital secrets of the CIS.
TEXT_MISSION_GUNNING_GUNRAY_SPEECH_02,Asajj Ventress:  Move one of our ships closer to the Jedi cruiser to begin the boarding maneuver.

TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_01_ALT_01,Rule Davenbay:  Welcome back to Dateline Coruscant. Today with me is my coll-- *rrhkzzz*
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_01_ALT_02,Rule Davenbay: And now a scheduled presentation from the Grand Army of the Republic.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_02,Ultana Anya:  Long time no see, Rule. Glad to finally be back in the Core.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_02_ALT_01,Ryloth Resa:  This broadcast has been liberated by the Shadowfeed, your daily Separatist news update!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_02_ALT_02,Ahalas Svindren: Greetings citizens, this is Major Svindren. I'm here to talk about the topic that won't let itself go ignored; separatism.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_03,Rule Davenbay:  And we're just as glad. What's your initial take on the state of the Outer Rim amid the war, Anya?
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_03_ALT_01,The simpering Kath hounds of the HoloNet are refusing to address the facts, dear listeners. The Separatist Alliance is getting closer to Coruscant by the day.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_03_ALT_02,The worst excesses of rebellion and anarchy tear at our society, but naive minds continue to pay mind to oft debunked arguments.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_04,Ultana Anya:  It's infuriating, Rule. The Separatists and the treacherous aliens in their ranks are determined to destroy civilisation itself.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_04_ALT_01,Count Dooku won't stop until that lying Chancellor and his Jedi pawns are all held accountable for their crimes against freedom and prosperity.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_04_ALT_02,The words of Dooku, whose title is not worth the oxygen it takes to say it, bewitch the masses when they have proven hollow at every turn.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_05,You have Skakoans running roughshod over every backwater they conquer, to the Gossam developing weapons of mass destruction, potentially against Coruscant!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_05_ALT_01,Only then, only then I say, will we have true peace in this galaxy again!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_05_ALT_02,How can one trust a self-proclaimed man of peace, who has schemed to prevent any serious hope of it even among sympathizers in the Senate?
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_06,The meat droids are pushing them back as best as they're programmed too, but the Jedi keep sending them and the Republic into losing battles like Jabiim.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_06_ALT_01,The Republic claims that our heroic freedom fighters are acting akin to HoloNet serial villains, acting without just cause.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_06_ALT_02,Who can trust the nobility of a man who conspires with thugs like Nute Gunray, the worst example of both corporate and Neimoidian culture?
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_07,Our benevolent Chancellor tries to see the best in that archaic order out of tradition, but monks should not be in charge of our military.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_07_ALT_01,Yet it is the Republic's own inefficacy and failure as a governing body, from the Yam'rii Crisis to the Stark Hyperspace War, that is villainous.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_07_ALT_02,Even now when the butcher General Grievous hopes to drown the Core in blood, Dooku's cries of oppression and tyranny do not abate!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_08,All the while, the Jedi have not even accepted any culpability over their 'former' members who participate in this insurrection. It's deplorable!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_08_ALT_01,If it weren't for the Confederacy, the decaying conditions of the Rim would only worsen while the Core fattens itself further off our taxes!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_08_ALT_02,I'd like to take these last moments to address you directly, Dooku. This is not a revolution you have sparked. This is death and finality. 
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_09,Rule Davenbay:  A very passionate report Anya, thank you for your valued contribution.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_09_ALT_01,So I encourage you, don't listen to their propaganda. The truth is out there!  Ryloth Resa out--
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_09_ALT_02,If you truly desire peace, act on it. Surrender yourself and end this senseless war, or else civilisation itself will plunge into freefall.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_10,We will continue our interview later tonight, but now back to Dyslogia Twang with the reports of the GravBall championship!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_10_ALT_01,Rule Davenbay:  *rrhkzzz* --back to Dyslogia Twang with the reports of the GravBall championship!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_10_ALT_02,And to you citizens of the Republic, I bid you safe tidings and farewell. This is Major Svindren, signing off.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_11,General Grievous:  This is the main HoloNet relay centre for the Core. I want it to be turned into ash.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_12,Without it, the Republic won't know about our assault on Kuat until it's too late.

TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_02,On the very principles this Republic is built on!
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_03,These criminals held the Senate and our Chancellor hostage to demand the release of one of their own
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_04,a Hutt Lord named Ziro.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_05,To reach their target, they not only massacred eighty-six of our comrades, my dear son among them
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_06,they spat on the ideals of order and justice that we are sworn to protect!
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_07,In this very moment, Ziro and his army of bandits and gangsters are trying to smuggle him out of the city.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_08,We cannot let this happen!  We will repay this stain on our honor!  We will avenge our brothers and sisters!
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_09,We will tear this city apart if we have to.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_10,---Now, drag that fat slug out of his hole!
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_11,Ziro Desilijic Tiure:  This is the dumbest plan I've ever heard!
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_12,We should have been off this horrible planet by now... And where is this Bane anyway?
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_13,Bossk:  Ssshut up and leave the detailsss to us.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_14,Bane is currently ssstealing the clearance codesss and will meet usss at the ssshuttle.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_15,Dengar:  Lizzy here is right. Without them, we'd be blown out of the sky in an instant.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_16,And anyway, we need a proper distraction regardless, which is what we're sitting around for.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_17,But our boss planned ahead. In a few hours
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_18,the streets will be flooded with enough chaos for us to just sneak away.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_19,Ziro Desilijic Tiure:  Why is the universe always just so gruesome to me?
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_20,Bossk:  The riotsss are breaking out, time to bail.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_21,Ziro Desilijic Tiure:  Finally, I never want to see this disgusting planet ever again!

TEXT_MISSION_LAUGHING_LANCE_SPEECH_04,We're trying to get as many civilians out from the frontlines as possible. Especially if the Seppies are advancing as much as they say.

TEXT_MISSION_LAUGHING_LANCE_SPEECH_06,those traitors are just covering for the failures of their tin man general. HoloNet News told me all about how they lie.

TEXT_MISSION_REKKIAD_RUNES_SPEECH_11,I struggle to see why you needed me for this.
TEXT_MISSION_REKKIAD_RUNES_SPEECH_12,Emissary:  A warrior of your skill is only a benefit on such unfamiliar terrain. And was it not your own choice to join me?
TEXT_MISSION_REKKIAD_RUNES_SPEECH_13,It was you who knew the importance of our meeting before I even made my case.

TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_SHOWDOWN_SPEECH_03,			  Officer, relay an open broadcast. I want everyone to hear this, including that monster.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_SHOWDOWN_SPEECH_04,This is Onara Kuat, Kuat of Kuat. We are the foundry of the galaxy.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_SHOWDOWN_SPEECH_05,For thousands of years, Kuat has been the guardian of peace and justice for the Republic, the Pride of the Core.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_SHOWDOWN_SPEECH_06,Coruscant may be the Republic's heart, but our creations have been the blood and iron that kept it pumping.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_SHOWDOWN_SPEECH_07,Our foundries are what kept the enemies of our proud civilisation at bay!
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_SHOWDOWN_SPEECH_08,And no miserable collection of incompetent second-class droids will change this. Not today, not while House Kuat stands firm!
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_SHOWDOWN_SPEECH_09,General Grievous:  An impressive performance for a mere businesswoman. But heroic speeches will not prevent your doom.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_SHOWDOWN_SPEECH_10,				    Now watch as your great shipyards rain down on Kuat's surface and become a pyre to our victory.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_SHOWDOWN_SPEECH_11,Vazus Mandrake:  Mandrake here. How could you start the party without fireworks?

TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_STRUGGLE_SPEECH_03,...Besides, these Kuat sadsacks are too busy pretending Grievous isn't on their doorstep to worry about mercs like us.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_STRUGGLE_SPEECH_04,Vazus Mandrake:  Quiet you two!  As long as we move quickly and don't get trigger happy,...
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_STRUGGLE_SPEECH_05,...we won't have any problems with the KDY goons along the way. And don't pretend like you aren't listening Bossk. You can add to your scoreboard another day.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_STRUGGLE_SPEECH_06,Bossk:  Hmph, copy that, bosssss.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_STRUGGLE_SPEECH_07,Vazus Mandrake:  The task is simple. We just need to get to the access terminal and deactivate the sensors.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_STRUGGLE_SPEECH_08,"ALARM! ALARM!  Hostile intruders have entered the station!  Shoot on sight!"
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_STRUGGLE_SPEECH_09,Bossk:  It wasss indeed eassssier than expected.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_STRUGGLE_SPEECH_10,KDY Security:  You there!  What are you doing here?  You have no clearance for this area!
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_STRUGGLE_SPEECH_11,Vazus Mandrake:  We--- Ah, whatever... It was getting boring anyway.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_STRUGGLE_SPEECH_12,Vazus Mandrake:  Okay, the signal is out and the long range scanners are offline...
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_STRUGGLE_SPEECH_13,...The fleet will arrive here soon, so our window is closing. We need to get to the command centre to reprogram the weapon systems.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_STRUGGLE_SPEECH_14,Bossk:  It sssseemssss our little sssstunt drew some attention to ussss.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_STRUGGLE_SPEECH_15,Vazus Mandrake:  Okay, we don't have much time until the Separatists arrive. Hurry up.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_STRUGGLE_SPEECH_16,Dengar:  Copy that Boss. Last thing we want is that crazy droid going after our heads.
TEXT_MISSION_SHIPYARD_STRUGGLE_SPEECH_17,Vazus Mandrake:  Keep talking like that and you'll be lucky if it's just your head he starts with.

TEXT_MISSION_STATION_STORMING_SPEECH_07,I love the Republic, but I don't think it will survive. Not as it is now.

TEXT_MISSION_STATION_STORMING_SPEECH_18,Orley Vanicus:  Ha, is that why you're here? Revenge? How trite.
TEXT_MISSION_STATION_STORMING_SPEECH_19,Mandalore the Ultimate:  Revenge? Oh, nothing so simple. In fact, I wanted to thank you.
TEXT_MISSION_STATION_STORMING_SPEECH_20,My predecessor was a fool who kowtowed to sorcerers and only had the good sense to die in battle.
TEXT_MISSION_STATION_STORMING_SPEECH_21,It sickened me at first. But then fate led me to his mask, and a vision of the future.
TEXT_MISSION_STATION_STORMING_SPEECH_22,A vision I have forged into reality. So again, I thank you, Admiral. For helping cause all of this.
TEXT_MISSION_STATION_STORMING_SPEECH_23,Orley Vanicus:  ...Are you done? I'm about to fall asleep from your senseless yapping.

TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_02,Anakin Skywalker:  Commander Appo... I know you and the 501st have served alongside Jedi for years.
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_03,But there can be no room for doubt here. The Order's treason must be purged.
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_04,Appo:  You misunderstand me, sir; has the Chancellor approved the assault?
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_05,Anakin Skywalker:  He has. No Jedi must survive.
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_06,Appo:  Then orders are orders. The 501st is yours, as always.
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_07,Are the initiates disposable as well?
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_08,Anakin Skywalker:  ... As you said, orders are orders.

TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_17,Anakin Skywalker:  You're right, Torbin. You are no Jedi.
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_18,And you're in luck. The Chancellor does want you to speak... To Director Isard.
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_19,Laddinare Torbin:  Isard!? No, you can't do this to me Skywalker! I've covered up so many rumors about you, heard so many things-

TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_27,Jocasta Nu:  And perhaps you should have spent more time in the library.
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_28,Jocasta Nu:  *URK*
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_29,Anakin Skywalker:  You thought you could defy me? You should've kept to your records.

TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_32,Cin Drallig:  What? Could the prophecy have been so wrong... Serra, take who you can and escape. I will hold them off as long as possible.
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_33,Serra Keto:  There is no escape, the clones are everywhere! I know Anakin, and if he won't hear reason, I'll take him down myself!
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_34,Cin Drallig:  Serra, no, wait!
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_35,Cin Drallig:  Skywalker... So it is true, you have embraced the dark side. Have you listened so little to our teachings?
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_36,Anakin Skywalker:  Your lessons have not proven useful to the corpses littering the temple, Master Drallig. I am now more powerful than any Jedi.
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_37,Cin Drallig:  Your attempts to incite me are fruitless. I saw you enter this place as a boy, and even as a man you are still that scared child.
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_38,Cin Drallig:  There's one lesson left to teach you now, Sith. How to become one with the Force.
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_39,Anakin Skywalker:  I am no longer the learner. It's your turn now!
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_40,Anakin Skywalker:  This will be a day long remembered. Soon the Jedi will be no more.
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_41,Sidious:  Good... goooooood. You have done well my apprentice.
TEXT_MISSION_TEMPLE_TRAGEDY_SPEECH_42,With the next generation of Jedi dead and the heart of their Order with them, any survivors who slip through the cracks will be insignificant!

TEXT_MISSION_TOMB_TORMENT_ALT_01_SPEECH_11,Sora Bulq:  Yes, my lord. What shall we do with the holocron? It seems to be of Sith origin, similar to the one Quinlan Vos retrieved.
TEXT_MISSION_TOMB_TORMENT_ALT_01_SPEECH_12,It could prove useful. If it is truly a Sith holocron the secrets hidden in it might be worth our time.

TEXT_MISSION_TOMB_TORMENT_SPEECH_10,Grand Master Yoda:  Not the time for jokes this is, young Skywalker. Heroes we lost today.. Friends... Questions the Senate will have.
TEXT_MISSION_TOMB_TORMENT_SPEECH_11,Anakin Skywalker:  I apologize, Master. I was just trying to lift the mood. Governor Tarkin has informed me that the majority of the cultists have escaped.
TEXT_MISSION_TOMB_TORMENT_SPEECH_12,Not few have taken control over the nearby systems and subjugated the local governments, calling themselves 'Jedi Lords'.
TEXT_MISSION_TOMB_TORMENT_SPEECH_13,Grand Master Yoda:  Only the head the dragonsnake lost today. Fearing the Jedi name the public will, the longer the traitors remain in power.

TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_03,Apparently they are reporting a Mandalorian invasion?
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_04,Chief Operator Haagen:  Stop making me laugh, helmsman. If anyone enters the system, we'd know it first.
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_05,Besides that, the Mandies haven't made any meaningful conquest since Flashpoint and that was four months ago.

TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_10,Mandalore the Ultimate:  Then the path to Taris is clear, at last.
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_11,Even Admiral Veltraa cannot mind the frontier and the home front at the same time.
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_12,Lt. Morvis:  Helmsman, keep the Courageous at the center of the line.
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_13,I guess this isn't the time to suggest to Captain Karath that there might be some openings soon at Admiral--
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_14,Captain Karath:  Defeat is not a career opportunity, Morvis--
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_15,--It's just defeat.
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_16,Lt. Morvis:  Captain, it's the ship of the Jedi traitor Carrick!
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_17,Gunnery reports he just went to hyperspace... towards Mandalorian space.
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_18,Captain Karath:  That's it, then. Our Jedi killer was a Mandie operative!
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_19,I'll deal with Zayne Carrick personally, provided we survive today. All forces retreat, we will regroup at Taris!
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_20,Cassus Fett:  The Republic fleet is retreating. Most likely towards Taris.
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_21,Mandalore the Ultimate:  What about Vanquo itself?
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_22,Cassus Fett:  Minimal resistance, outside one of the miners putting up a fight.
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_23,Furthermore, our troops report that they took a live Jedi, of all things. All alone there.
TEXT_MISSION_VANQUO_VANISHING_SPEECH_24,Mandalore the Ultimate:  They're becoming thick as mynocks all of a sudden.  More meat for Demagol.

TEXT_PLANET_INFO_AARGAU_HISTORY,Aargau was a member of the Galactic Republic from its discovery until the end of that galactic power. After the fall of the Galactic Empire, it was considered a New Republic stronghold. The region of space occupied by the planet would later fall under the hegemony of first the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, and then subsequently Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire. Despite this, Aargau took a neutral approach to politics, which meant that warring factions were mutually welcome to conduct business on the planet. The planetary government imposed only three laws on citizens and visitors, called the Three Statutes of Aargau. These laws focused on the export of Aargau's natural resources, the absolute ban on weapons for visitors—and, conversely, the requirement to bear arms for Aargauuns—as well as maintaining the integrity of the Bank of Aargau. Breaking any of these rules was punishable by immediate execution.

The planet was once home to the Ones, physical manifestations of the Force referred to as the Son, the Daughter and the Father who represented in turn the dark side, light side and balance of the Force. A fourth being, a mortal woman who served the Ones and later became the Mother, kept the peace between Son and Daughter. In an attempt to gain immortality the Mother drank from the Font of Power and bathed in the Pool of Knowledge, but the experiences from those Force Nexuses corrupted her and she became a powerful, twisted entity known as Abeloth, Bringer of Chaos. Seeing this, the Father, Son and Daughter instructed the Killiks to build Centerpoint Station and other facilities to imprison Abeloth on the planet for eternity.

The Wookiees inhabit the wroshyr trees in huge cities that are naturally supported by the thick branches. The canopies provide a natural cover and lower aerial visibility into the Wookiee cites. Despite this, Trandoshan slavers routinely land and operate on the planet to capture Wookiees for slave labor. During the Clone Wars the planet gladly aligned itself with the Galactic Republic. By 19 BBY General Grievous oversaw preparations for the pivotal battle to capture the planet, however, he was recalled to the Deep Core by Darth Sidious for the Battle of Coruscant and the abduction of the Supreme Chancellor.

Covered with sprawling mountains and robust architecture, the Miraluka saw its natural beauty through their innate sensitivity with Force. When the Sith began a series of divide-and-conquer tactics in the aftermath of the Jedi Civil War, Master Vandar Tokare called a council on Katarr with most of the surviving Jedi to assess their course. However, news of the meeting was leaked by the Jedi historian Atris to the Sith, in hopes to lure them out. What resulted was the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus descending on the planet, devouring the life of all on its surface save one survivor, Visas Marr.

Huge walled cities and a dark side theocracy emerged to protect the people from the beasts, but exiled prisoners learned to control the beasts and overthrew the dark side rulers, effectively firing the opening shots of the Great Sith War. Despite eventual victory for the light side, Onderon has always been a focus of dark energy.

TEXT_PLANET_INFO_ORAX_HISTORY,Located in the Outer Rim, Orax is a world of beautiful rock and mineral formations and natural hot springs. The planets native lifeforms, the Shards, are an intelligent silicone-based species that grow in the shape of crystals in clusters of rocks near the mineral rich springs. The Shards are able to sense and produce electromagnetic charges, which allows them to form a single group-mind and interact with computers and electrical pulses from technology. Orax would be discovered about a century before the fall of the Old Republic by a mining expedition, and after some initial confusion the miners and Shards were able to communicate. Republic technicians built a droid-control interface that allowed the Shards to disconnect from their growth-rocks and inhabit droid bodies, granting them mobile and sensory input. Dozens of Shards then traversed the galaxy both to act as ambassadors to their people and to enjoy new experiences. When the Palpatine's New Order emerged, many of these Shards were hunted down and killed due to anti-alien and droid prejudice. The Empire aggressively mined Orax durings its reign, and banned droids from Orax to prevent the Shards from inhabiting them, pushing some to ally with the Rebel Alliance. After the Empire's defeat at the Battle of Endor, mining operations on Orax ceased, but the planets ecology was devastated. The New Republic upon learning of their plight would re-establish diplomatic relations with the Shards and provided droid and ecological aid in exchange for limited mineral rights on Orax.

Later, Mandalore the Indomitable's successor, Mandalore the Ultimate, also had a vision on Shogun. This led him to decree that non-Taungs would be admitted to Mandalorian clans if they proved themselves worthy in battle and upheld Mandalorian honor.

Powerful beyond reckoning, the Duinuogwuins preferred to avoid contact with the rest of the galaxy, staying largely uninvolved with galactic affairs. Xuaquarres, thought to be named for the mythological elder dragon Xua, was host to the Graveyard of the Dragons - a series of honeycombed caves in which the Duinuogwuins would go to die as they neared the end of their long lives. Due to their longevity, the planet was seldom visited by the Duinuogwuins, and the Galactic Empire would establish a royal Imperial Storehouse similar to the one on Mount Tantiss. Whether the Empire knew about the Duinuogwuins' graveyard is unclear, but when a group of space faring adventurers accidentally alerted the Duinuogwuins, the Star Dragons would return and wreak havoc, destroying the entire Imperial fortress and allowing the would-be heroes to escape with their lives.

TEXT_RESOURCES_HEADER,=============         RESOURCES        =============
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW,There are multiple resources in EaWX: 
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_1,- CREDITS: Generated by planets and economic buildings and used to purchase units and buildings. Also, many special events, research, etc. cost credits to initiate.
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_2,- SHIP CREWS: Generated by planets above a certain influence level, as well as Naval Academies, Space Colonies, and select special structures. Crews are spent when constructing ships.
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_3,- POPULATION: Global limit on how many ships and units you can have at once. Increase this cap by conquering planets and building Space Colonies.
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_4,- INFLUENCE: Each planet you control has its own Influence score. It measures how much that planet's population supports your rule. Planets with low influence can revolt and forcibly eject your troops. Planets with high influence sometimes offer unique buildable units.
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_5,- INFRASTRUCTURE: This is the difference between your territory's total capacity for structures and the number of structures you've actually built. When you have too many empty structure slots, credit prices and build times for everything will rise.
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_6,- WORLD DEVASTATOR MATERIALS: Gained by fielding World Devastators and destroying enemy units and structures in tactical space battles.

TEXT_SPEECH_BULWARK_UNLOCK2,New Hero: Dua Ningo (Bulwark-I)
TEXT_SPEECH_BULWARK1_RESEARCH,Wat Tambor: The Techno Union has been developing a new set of battlecruisers from our shipyards at Foerost. Its firepower will mark a new chapter in this war and allow us to compete directly with the newer Republic capital ships. Our associates at Sullust have expressed interest as well, and one of their Home Guard officers has already volunteered to lead the initial fleet. If the Confederacy would be wise enough to invest in this project, I assure you the war will quickly turn in our favour.
TEXT_SPEECH_BULWARK1_RESEARCH_FINISHED,Wat Tambor: The Bulwark Fleet is now at your disposal; make the Republic scum squirm.\n[Bulwark-I Unlocked] 
TEXT_SPEECH_BULWARK2_RESEARCH,Wat Tambor: Following the successful deployment of the Bulwark-I and subsequent engagements with the Republic's Victory Fleet, we have developed plans for an up-scaled version fit for mass-production, the Bulwark-II. This battlecruiser will be one of the largest capital ships in the Separatist arsenal, and with it in deployment the Republic cannot hope to outmatch us in the field. Once we receive an initial investment the Techno Union and our associates at TransGalMeg are prepared to begin production.

TEXT_SPEECH_CONQUER_RENDILI_FINISHED,Mellor Yago: Dallin is a fool. He is spilling Rendili blood for a Republic that is only fuelling chaos and subjugates our mighty home while keeping us small. Rendili will be free. We won't rot in Kuat's shadow any longer.
TEXT_SPEECH_CONQUER_TARIS_MANDO_FINISHED,Mandalorian Rally Master: Our occupation of Taris is going smoothly, with fresh recruits already being lined up to receive their armor.

TEXT_SPEECH_CONQUER_VANQUO_FINISHED,Mandalorian Rally Master: We encountered great resistance along one of Vanquo's mines. It took two weeks and a dozen of my men to find out it was one simple miner holding us off! A warriors spirit like that would of great value to our crusade, so we made him an offer to join us or the slave pits. Needless to say, he made the right choice.

TEXT_SPEECH_VICTORY1_RESEARCH,Walex Blissex: With your approval, Rendili and Kuat have approached me about creating a new type of destroyer for Republic use, the Victory-class. Compared to the Venator's design as a carrier-destroyer, the Victory will serve as a dedicated planetary assault ship featuring numerous turbolasers and missile tubes. My talks with High Command assured me this 'Victor Initiative' will round out the Republic Navy's offensive power significantly, and Kuat Drive Yards and Rendili StarDrive have both expressed interest in developing the initial production line.
TEXT_SPEECH_VICTORY1_RESEARCH_FINISHED,Walex Blissex: A remarkable vessel. With the engineering breakthroughs we tackled developing her, she's just the start of things to come.\n[Victory-I Star Destroyer Unlocked] 
TEXT_SPEECH_VICTORY2_RESEARCH,KDY Representative: The Victor Initiative Project has proven its combat effectiveness and our team at Kuat along with our Rendili counterparts have formulated further ways to improve the existing Victory-I Star Destroyer design. Our proposed Victory-II iteration will include increased speed along with heavy turbolasers and ion cannons, to counter larger Separatist warships. The engineers at Kuat and Rendili are ready if High Command would invest in it, but I assure you it will be well worth it.

TEXT_STORY_FOEROST_CAMPAIGN_LORE_BODY_01,During the Great Sith War, used as a military staging area, while in more recent centuries, purchased by the Techno Union, the shipyards of Foerost were located at the heart of the Galactic Deep Core. When the Confederacy and the Techno Union declared war on the Republic, the Senate send multiple fleets out to siege the planet.
TEXT_STORY_FOEROST_CAMPAIGN_LORE_BODY_02,Without access to Separatist supply lines, the Republic hoped the shipyards would wither into decay. For nearly two years, the standoff continued until the besieged Techno Union engineers exploded from Foerost with warships that no one had imagined.

TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_BLISSEX_RESEARCH_FUNDING_BLISSEX_SPEECH_01,Lira Blissex:  I'm pleased to see how well my Tector has performed in your recent battles. Sadly, it seems the Senate budget committee feels that the Tector and its siblings are too expensive to justify further production. Of course, if a decorated commander such as yourself were to speak to the Senators about the utility of these new vessels, I'm sure they would change their minds.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_CORE_WORLDS_SECURITY_ACT_PALPATINE_SPEECH_01,Supreme Chancellor Palpatine:  It seems our paths cross only when the days darken. Yet, it can't be denied, that you led us successful through it all so I hope, we can work together once more. My staff and I have presented the senate a new act to increase your and my emergency powers to quickly stop the looming threat of separatism here in the Core. Since many senators still trust your judgement, I am sure should you support this act many others will as well.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_MILITARY_BILL_MOTHMA_SPEECH_01,Mon Mothma:  Advisor Pestage believes that the revenue generated by deregulating the banks will sustainably fund our military, but he's wrong. The funds raised would be a one-time payment, in exchange for wiping out government oversight of the entire financial sector. Please speak out against this bill. I promise you, I'll find some other way to fund your forces.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_MILITARY_BILL_MOTHMA_SPEECH_02,Senator Mon Mothma:  My fellow Senators and I thank you for your support. If we were to sell our principles in the name of defeating the Confederacy, could we really call that a victory? Only by holding on to what we are can the Republic hope to endure these dark times.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_MILITARY_BILL_PESTAGE_SPEECH_01,Sate Pestage:  The Republic cannot afford to continue developing new military technology unless it taps new sources of revenue. The loyal banking interests have informed the Chancellor that their cash reserves could be placed at our disposal, were it not for certain regulatory issues. As such, the Chancellor would like you to support a bill that will cut some red tape in banking and secure funding for advanced weapons and equipment.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_MILITARY_BILL_PESTAGE_SPEECH_02,Advisor Sate Pestage:  Excellent choice, Commander. As soon as Lama Su was informed of this development, he had his engineers devise an upgraded form of the standard Clone Trooper armor. Your wisdom in choosing to support the Chancellor is already paying dividends for the Republic.\n[Phase 2 Clone Research is now available on Kamino]
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_SECURITY_MOTHMA_SPEECH_01,Senator Mon Mothma:  Hello. The Senate is about to make a critical mistake that could cost us more than just the war: Our freedom and democracy. In this moment, the Senate plans to pass an act that grants the Chancellor even more control and power... It will legalize house searches, trials without lawyers, imprisonment without evidence. I know some of Palpatine's confidantes approached you already, yet I urge you to take position against this act.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_SECURITY_MOTHMA_SPEECH_02,Senator Mon Mothma:  It warms my heart that you chose the right way.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_SECURITY_TARKIN_SPEECH_01,Senator Shayla Paige-Tarkin:  Greetings. I hope you enjoy your time here in the galactic south. Eriadu and family are thankful for your help in silencing those crazy Jedi. For far too long were they allowed to roam free without supervision. This is also why I came to you. You have lots of admirers among my colleagues and soon a referendum will be held about an act that grants the Chancellor more powers while also places the Council below his jurisdiction.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_SECURITY_TARKIN_SPEECH_02,Senator Shayla Paige-Tarkin:  An excellent choice. You know how to stand on the right side of history... Reminds me of Wilhuff. You both definitely share the ruthlessness and tactical brilliance.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_FUTURE_MOTHMA_SPEECH_01,Mon Mothma:  I represent a party of Senators who oppose Chancellor Palpatine. We believe that he has abused his emergency powers to prolong this war indefinitely and become a military dictator. Your victories have given you influence over many undecided Senators. We beg you to speak out in support of our motion for a vote of no confidence in the Chancellor.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_FUTURE_MOTHMA_SPEECH_02,Supreme Chancellor Mon Mothma:  I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. I promise that I will never lose faith in the Jedi Order, and always to respect their wise counsels, as they are true guardians of the Republic. Though recent years have been darkened by war, I believe it is time for the sun to rise again.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_FUTURE_PALPATINE_SPEECH_01,Palpatine:  I'm told that certain Senators have made unfounded accusations against me. I assure you, I have sought to end this war as swiftly as possible, but the scheming of the Senators has been a greater obstacle to victory than the droid army. You are a hero in the eyes of many wavering Senators - if you were to speak to them, they would surely see things our way.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_FUTURE_PALPATINE_SPEECH_02,Palpatine:  Now that you have proven your loyalty to the Republic, I can tell you the truth: the conspiracy in the Senate has its roots in the Jedi Council! It seems their command over the Grand Army has gone to their heads and now they wish to take over the Republic for themselves. For the Republic to survive, I see no choice but to issue emergency Order 66 immediately.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_FUTURE_PALPATINE_SPEECH_NON_REPUBLIC,Palpatine:  The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger!

My work and I speak for ourselves, and neither of us would want that to change. The Republic needs our ships. Something the Chancellor knows and respects. Yet some senators like Giddean Danu of my own home planet of Kuat seem to not understand the importance of KDY and Kuat in the galaxy. I have set in motion a referendum to have that annoyance be recalled and your support in the senate and throughout the galaxy in unmatched. If you help me, it might prove useful for you.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_KUAT_POWER_STRUGGLE_ONARA_SPEECH_02,Onara Kuat:  My recent flagship is nearing completion and will likely just gather dust above Kuat. I am sure you will find it a useful extension of your naval forces.\n[Onara Kuat can be upgraded on Kuat to a Mandator-II]

When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators. Their betrayal will be dealt with.

Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_SECTOR_GOVERNANCE_DECREE_MOTHMA_SPEECH_01,Mon Mothma:  I'm told that the Chancellor is considering a decree that will transfer more power to the sector army commanders from local authorities. I don't believe we must further empower the military governors to win the war. I fear that if we do, it will be impossible to return to civilian government. Please, I implore you to speak against this measure.

Now the real war begins. We shall break the Republic's defensive line around Taris, and carry that momentum down into the Core. The Neo-Crusaders shall be the bulwark of our invasion, bringing fresh recruits and slaves into our war machine with every conquest. Soon the galaxy shall learn to fear the Mandalorians once more!
TEXT_STORY_INTRO_PROGRESSIVE_REPUBLIC_3957_START,Supreme Chancellor Tol Cressa: The Republic is on the brink commander. Revan has brought us defeat after defeat, and even now with the Dark Lord dead the apprentice Malak has taken control of the Sith Empire. Malak is even more brutal than his master, and with the Sith armada growing stronger by the day, only the Jedi may be able to save us now.

If that was not enough some of our most decorated officers like Admiral Karath have defected over to him. Large swathes of the galaxy now lie under Sith control, and with Revan's genius now turned against the Republic we will need to muster everything we can to stop them. The Jedi Order have thankfully offered their assistance, and we will need them in the times ahead.

Therefore by my authority as Supreme Chancellor, I decree Revan commander of the Republic's military forces. May the Force be with us all.

The Republic and Jedi have failed in their duty, and so they have become my enemies. Already old loyalists and fresh converts bolster our ranks, with more to come whether willingly or not.

TEXT_STORY_RIMWARD_CRAWL_HEADER,A Galaxy Divided
TEXT_STORY_RIMWARD_HUTTS_CRAWL_BODY_01,Peril looms large! Following the annihilation of the Malevolence, the nefarious General Grievous has retreated deeper into the Galactic Rim, leaving a trail of destruction in his wake, decimating innocent worlds. The Republic's grip on the Outer Rim teeters on the brink of collapse, with the Hutts, who once relied on Republic protection against Separatist assaults, growing increasingly restless.
TEXT_STORY_RIMWARD_HUTTS_CRAWL_BODY_02,Simultaneously, the GRAND HUTT COUNCIL has hatched a daring plan, conspiring to seize power. Recognizing that Republic prisoner Ziro Desilijic Tiure possesses damning information about the council's members, they've gathered the deadliest criminals in the galaxy to liberate Ziro from captivity and whisk him back to Hutt-controlled space.
TEXT_STORY_RIMWARD_HUTTS_CRAWL_BODY_03,As the enigmatic Cad Bane executes a daring extraction mission to free Ziro from Coruscant's clutches, on the swampy world of NAL HUTTA, the council convenes to deliberate their course of action. They ponder whether maintaining neutrality in this conflict remains the wisest choice, unaware that Ziro's escape may unleash consequences far more profound than they ever imagined....

TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_MANDO_DESTROYED_SPEECH_01,Mandalore:  I can scarcely believe that such a thing could have existed in this galaxy... But for all its size and power, it could not stand before the Mando'ade. This day shall live on in story and song as the day of our greatest victory! Vor entye, vod!
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_MANDO_DESTROYED_SPEECH_02,Now that we've taken away their precious toy, the Sith are revealed as the weaklings they have always been. They still have their mundane factories and shipyards, to be sure, but the Sith will not be pulling any more battlecruisers from empty space.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_MANDO_MAIN_SPEECH_01,Mandalore:  Our torture masters have extracted a dire secret from a few recently deceased captives... A secret that may lead us to the most glorious and honorable battle in the history of the Mando'ade. According to the dead, the fleets the Sith have pulled out of the ether are in truth the product of an ancient machine of unimaginable capacity created by an ancient civilization. 
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_MANDO_MAIN_SPEECH_02,Normally, I wouldn't give much credence to the dying words of frightened men, but my Gogi squads indicate that this is what the Republic believes, far-fetched though it may be. They don't know where this mystical 'Star Forge' is located, but they believe that it was first found by combining fragments of ancient star maps scattered across worlds throughout the galaxy. 
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_MANDO_MAIN_SPEECH_03,Crippling the Sith in a single decisive battle would be so great a prize that I cannot dismiss these rumors out of hand. We must pursue these star maps and learn if the rumors of magic factories left behind by lost empires hold any truth.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_MANDO_PREATTACK_SPEECH_01,Mandalore:  The star maps are ours, and it seems our torture masters live up to their reputation – under their tender ministrations, the dead spoke truly. Kelborn has sifted through the fragments of data from the various maps and found that they trace a route to a system deep in the Unknown Regions.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_MANDO_PREATTACK_SPEECH_02,The scout team I dispatched has already reported back that the path is stable and the system at its end is host to a titanic orbital facility. This can only be the Star Forge.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_MANDO_PREATTACK_SPEECH_03,Now it is your task to prepare for our decisive battle with the Sith. Muster our warriors; we strike for the glory of Manda'lor!
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_MANDO_SURVIVED_SPEECH_01,Mandalore:  Bic ni skana'din! The Sith shabuir have used their foul sorcery to repulse our fleet. The Star Forge is indeed a mighty weapon, larger and more powerful than I believed could exist.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_MANDO_SURVIVED_SPEECH_02,No matter. We shall burn our dead, salve our wounds, and wait for another opportunity to strike. The Sith will be watchful against another attack, but when their vigilance slackens, our victory will be all the more glorious for the blood we shed today!
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_DESTROYED_SPEECH_01,Admiral Dodonna: You have destroyed the Star Forge and broken the spirit of the Sith! For this I am proud to present you with the Cross of Glory, the highest honor the Republic can bestow.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_DESTROYED_SPEECH_02,Jedi Master Vandar:  On behalf of the Jedi Council, defenders of the galaxy and sworn protectors of the Republic, I would like to honor your momentous victory against the Sith and the destruction of the dreaded Star Forge.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_DESTROYED_SPEECH_03,We Jedi now have another tale to weave into the grand history of our eternal Order. Wherever you go, you will be recognized as the saviour of the galaxy. The hero of our age.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_MAIN_SPEECH_01,Jedi Master Vandar:  Greetings, Commander. Our studies and meditations have unraveled concerning mysteries but ones that might help us understand where the power and strength of the Sith Empire's war machine lies.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_MAIN_SPEECH_02,Our scholars and seers believe, that the heart of the Sith Empire is the machine called the Star Forge, a Dark Side-fueled factory of seemingly limitless capacity left behind by an ancient civilization. Unfortunately, the location of it has been lost to time, but this mustn't stop us.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_MAIN_SPEECH_03,We have reason to believe that one of our own found this unknown world by combining fragments of ancient star maps scattered across worlds throughout the galaxy. If we retrace their steps, we too may discover the secret location of this Star Forge.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_PREATTACK_SPEECH_01,Jedi Master Vandar:  Well done commander, our scholars now have enough star map fragments to piece together the location of the Star Forge.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_PREATTACK_SPEECH_02,By the Force! The location of the Star Forge is deep within the Unknown Regions, with no hyperspace lane recorded on our charts.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_PREATTACK_SPEECH_03,Thankfully one of our scholars has noticed that the Star Map planets have a direct link to the system. It is clear what must be done, the Star Forge must fall.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_SURVIVED_SPEECH_01,Admiral Dodonna:  Our Fleet was not enough to break through the Sith Armada and destroy the Star Forge. With it still operational the Republic is in grave danger.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_SURVIVED_SPEECH_02,Jedi Master Vandar:  Fortunately we still have a completed chart to the Star Forge, and as long as we still control the Star Map planets, we can attack again.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_DELAY_HINT,Take Star Map planets from the enemy to prevent them from launching another attack on the Star Forge.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_DESTROYED_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Sith Lord:  The Mandalorian animals have done the impossible and destroyed the Star Forge. This is a dire blow, to be sure, but the Sith have endured worse.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_DESTROYED_MANDO_SPEECH_02,Your carelessness has cost us our trump card, and may well cost us the galaxy. Unfortunately, we have no choice but to continue to rely on you, so you will survive your failure... For now...
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_DESTROYED_REP_SPEECH_01,Sith Lord:  Curse the Republic and curse the Jedi! Their ceaseless meddling has unraveled our great design once again.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_DESTROYED_REP_SPEECH_02,Without the Star Forge, we will have to defeat them with only what remains of our mundane resources and the power of the Dark Side.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_MAIN_HEADER,Story - Safeguard the Star Forge
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_MAIN_HINT,If either the Republic or Mandalorians take the required number of star map planets, they will immediately launch an attack. Even if neither enemy ever claims enough star maps, one will attack the Star Forge at a random time after you have conquered half of the planets on the map.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_MAIN_SPEECH_01,Sith Lord:  The heart of the Sith Empire is the Star Forge, a Dark Side-fueled factory of seemingly limitless capacity left behind by the fallen Rakatan Infinite Empire. Its location deep in the Unknown Regions is kept secret from our enemies. As long as it remains so, the Star Forge can continue to furnish us with enough materiel to conquer this galaxy.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_MAIN_SPEECH_02,Revan first discovered the Star Forge by combining fragments of ancient star maps scattered across worlds throughout the galaxy. If these map fragments were to fall into the hands of our enemies, they will surely follow Revan's trail back to us.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_MAIN_SPEECH_03,We know that rumors of the Star Forge are spreading despite our best efforts to preserve its secrecy. Our foes will surely find it eventually, even without the aid of the star maps. When – not if – they do, we must be prepared to fend off an all-out attack.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_PREATTACK_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Sith Lord:  I did not think the Mandalorian savages had enough intellect to decode the information from the star map fragments and find the location of the Star Forge.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_PREATTACK_MANDO_SPEECH_02,We need to recall our forces and defend against the Mandalorian Fleet. The survival of the Star Forge and Sith Empire depends on the outcome.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_PREATTACK_OBJECTIVE,Ships that you gather to %s will hyperjump to the Star Forge and defend it when the enemy arrives.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_PREATTACK_REP_SPEECH_01,Sith Lord:  Our worst fears have been realised, the Republic has collected enough star map fragments to piece together the location of the Star Forge.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_PREATTACK_REP_SPEECH_02,We need to recall our forces and defend against the Republic Fleet. The survival of the Star Forge and Sith Empire depends on the outcome.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_SURVIVED_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Sith Lord:  Good, very good. You have utterly vanquished the Mandalorian attack. Those savages who survived to flee must be too frightened to do more than cower in a dark hole.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_SURVIVED_MANDO_SPEECH_02,See that you keep hold of the star maps; if you do, the vermin shall not return to trouble the Star Forge again.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_SURVIVED_REP_SPEECH_01,Sith Lord:  Ah, to feel the deaths of Jedi ripple through the Force... Intoxicating. Fools that they are, the Republic may make another vain assault on the Star Forge if we don't take the star maps out of their hands.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_SURVIVED_REP_SPEECH_02,Further attempts would be futile, certainly, but nonetheless, we have more important matters to attend to than swatting flies away from the Star Forge. See that you reclaim those star maps.

Isard made a number of controversial moves to "fight corruption" and deal the the Separatist Crisis (that invariably gave Palpatine more power).

But when the Mandalorians were defeated, Bendak wandered as a bounty hunter briefly before an accidental murder pushed him into donning his armor again in the Taris dueling ring. Taking on "Starkiller" as a stage name, Bendak became an immediate hit with the Tarisian citizenry while dozens of duelists met their end at his blaster.

Fett's notoriety truly rose in the Imperial period; often employed by the Empire and Darth Vader specifically, Fett displayed deadly efficiency in taking down his bounties. While he was knocked in the Great Pit of Carkoon during a brawl on Tatooine, even a sarlacc could not hold Fett for long.

Growing up on Kamino, Boba was taught by his father at home and on the jobs he frequently accompanied him on.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_BRAND_FOTR,Empatojayos Brand was a Jedi Knight and former Padawan of Yaddle. He was part of the Jedi strike team sent to Geonosis to save Obi-wan Kenobi, and joined with Adi Gallia's Zeta Squadron to stop Cavik Toth from bombarding the planet with trihexalon. Brand became a Jedi General, and nine months into the war led clone troopers in a battle on Basssadro. The twelve day battle ended with Brand launching a missile barrage on the Separatists, which led to the death of 400 civilian miners, which was widely propagandized on the CIS shadowfeed. When Order 66 was issued Brand attempted to escape the Empire, and was chased down in his ship by Darth Vader. Vader shot him down, but Brand's ravaged body was recovered by the Ganathans, who outfitted him with a cyborg body. Believing no other Jedi remained and wishing to help the Ganathans, Brand became their king.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_BROADSIDE,"Broadside" was the nickname of an experienced clone trooper pilot who served in Shadow Squadron, a Galactic Republic fighter unit under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars.

This variant lacks even the fixed-forward ions that later attempts at the concept will include.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_BTLB_YWING_SHADOW,Comprised of clone pilots that received personal training from Anakin Skywalker himself, Shadow Squadron is a highly elite squadron that is attached to Admiral Yularen's complement.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_COYOTE_BOMBER,This wartime direct upgrade to an older Droid Bomber design spun off from the Vulture series. Employed by the Trade Federation in the subjugation of its corporate interests, and would fly under CIS colors when the Trade Federation pledged its military to the Separatists. It is similar to its peer the Hyena Bomber in role and power, swarming enemy capital ships to cripple or eliminate them while pushing through Republic fighter forces. Unusually for the size and design it is equipped with a weak shield, though it does make other performance sacrifices in comparison.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_CRABDROID,The most common iteration of a product line intended to bolster Techno Union profits rather than win wars, this model of crab droid serves as a light anti-infantry unit and, less commonly, espionage, light and medium armor variants.

When the Recusant-class Nova Defiant was shot down by Republic Star Destroyers and crashed on Innton II's surface, Dalesham concocted a plan to scavenge its remains and use its salvaged pieces to form a new base in a massive cavern on the planet. Under Dalesham's orders the most important sections of the ship such as the bridge and officers' galley were transferred, but the Clone Wars ended before the base could be completed.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DALLAN_MORVIS,Dallan Morvis was a scion of a prestigious family who joined the Republic Navy hoping to live up to their name. He served under Saul Karath, but faced harsh scrutiny following encounters with renegade Jedi Zayne Carrick. Both Morvis and Carrick would captured by Mandalorians and forcibly enlisted, until they helped foil Dorjander Kace's plot to kidnap Jedi children. Morvis would then request Carrick as an aide, seeing the Jedi's personality as complementary to his own.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_DARKNON,A type of way station built around navigational beacons that were designed to help archaic hyperdrive systems travel between the stars. As these nav beacons were critical to mapping important hyperspace lanes, stations such as the Darknon would be built to cater to the needs of travelers working their way up these risky routes. While these would decay over the millenmia from disuse as hyperdrives modernized, in their time the Darknon stations offered several valuable services to spacers including plentiful hangar space and serviceable defensive emplacements.

Despite being formally adopted into Clan Skirata, Darman was unable to desert the Empire like half of Omega Squad and was forced to become an Imperial Commando in Squad 40.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DAVAAB,The Davaab was a Core Galaxy Systems design some decades old, but very suitable for modification and a variety of tasks.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_DEFOLIATOR,An unusual artillery piece designed by Lok Durd to fit onto an AAT chasis. Specialty munitions use a chain-reaction incendiary energy type to cause effective wide-area damage against less-protected organic infantry and operators, but little against shielded or armoured targets. This model being built atop an AAT-1 provides the artillery with the defensive capabilities of the base design.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_DEHNO,A frontline Patrol Captain of Czerka Corporation, Dehno led slaving raids on Kashyyyk's Wookiee population. Not above putting down the 'merchandise' if they got out of hand, he was also paranoid of Czerka inspections which could have threatened his career.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_DELTA6,Outdated by the onset of the Clone Wars and replaced by the larger and much more capable Delta-7 Aethersprite. The Delta-6 is a fighter designed in the long tradition of lightweight and stripped-down fighters designed for Force users such as the Jedi. Effectively an engine with 2 laser cannons, the Delta relies on the special abilities of force users to excel but due to its cheap nature it is not uncommon for PDF forces to use the fighter with normal pilots. 
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DELTA7,A high performance KSE interceptor designed by Walex Blissex introduced right before the Clone Wars, the Delta-7 Aethersprite is considerably advanced for its time and expensive to match. The Jedi Order took a liking to the craft and it became the standard flight craft of many Jedi Knights for travel and reconnaissance in their duties. Armed with twin-barrelled laser cannons and powerful sub-light engines, its main weakness is a lack of internal hyperdrive due to lack of space, necessitating an external hyperdrive docking ring.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DEMAGOL,The greatest name in Mandalorian science since the Great Sith War, the 'flesh carver' Demagol is a secretive researcher feared and respected in equal measure. Supposedly an advisor to Mandalore the Ultimate, he was active since before the Mandalorian Wars capturing and experimenting on species in the Outer Rim. Demagol would develop a fascination with the Force and Jedi by proxy, seeking a scientific explanation for what he viewed as superstitious nonsense by studying and dissecting kidnapped Jedi from the Mandalorians conquest.

This new model is faster, better-armed, and more durable than its ancestors, but still lacks a shield generator - even the Star Forge has limits.

Its intent as a city-sized civlian platform grants the Kemplex a great deal of space that can be easily devoted to weapon banks and support craft.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_KOMRK,Kom'rk Skirata was a Null Class Advanced Recon Commando who started life known as Null-6.

Kom’rk specialised in espionage and interrogation with unique talent at extracting information out of people with one such highlight being the discovery of General Grievous' location. He would desert the Republic during Order 66 in order to live with his adoptive Mandalorian Clan Skirata.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_KOMRK_GUNSHIP,Coming from a Mandalorian word for Gauntlet, the Kom'r'k was used by the Mandalorians as both a fighter and transport. Despite being labelled as a fighter by its creators MandalMotors, the Kom'r'k was too large to actually be considered a fighter by the majority of people who instead classified it as an assault ship or gunship. A noticeable design feature was its wings which rotated to face upwards when landing to save horizontal space. The wings were also able to rotate 360 degrees around the main hull while the Gauntlet was in flight. While used by a variety of Mandalorian groups, it was their usage by the extremist group Death Watch which saw the most prominent usage during the Clone Wars.

She would later come across the Jedi Exile, who Kreia formed a Force bond with as they set out to find the remaining Jedi hiding from the Sith. Kreia is exceptionally talented with the Force despite her distaste in relying upon it. She can easily cloak her presence and read others minds, which she is keen to use when in battle or delivering lessons.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_MANKVIM,A swarm-based fighter with barely noticeable shields developed by the Techno Union, the design is most recognized for its impressive speed and saw proliferation into the Corporate Sector Authority and civilian markets after the Clone Wars. It is best used to intercept enemy bombers.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_MARAUDER,Originally designed by Sienar as a patrol and escort gunship for the Judicial Forces, the design was declined for purchase by the Republic government proper. Sienar instead ended up selling the hulls to other groups, including the Corporate Sector Authority and various independent groups, where the ships often ended up in pirate hands. It is well suited for supporting other vessels against capital ships.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_MARK_I_ASSAULT_DROID,Designed by Czerka Arms originally for garrison duties under the Republic, the Mark I Assault Droid was put to greater use by the Sith. Initially used to fill out holes in military recruitment during the early Jedi Civil War, they would become more common as boarding repellants for Sith vessels as the war continued. It could use its unipod to advance position before squatting down into a short, sleek profile to fire at the enemy while being difficult to target back. Militarized versions sold to the Sith feature decent shielding for its slow frame.

Has a significant amount of firepower but does not hold up when taking damage.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_MUNIFICENT_C3,Command, Control and Communications Munificent. One of many variations on the modular base design that adjusts weapon loadout to facilitate other functions, in this case more powerful sensors and comms systems compared to the already impressive base model.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_MUUGYN,Worr Muugyn was a young Mandalorian recruit who fought in a skirmish against Jedi during the Mandalorian Wars on Vur IV. When orders came to abandon the losing battle, Muugyn refused, gathering volunteers to hold a fortified location called 'Blood Ridge.' Sketching out a plan on leather cut from his tabard, Muugyn held out for several days against the mounting offensive. This perseverance paid off when Muugyn's defenders launched a counterattack, with Muugyn surviving the battle. His written plan would be venerated as a symbol of courage and determination to many Mandalorian clans for centuries.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_MYRIAL,Myrial was the Provisional Governor of Argazda, who established a dictatorship over the planet. She and her followers denounced the Republic as a corrupt and faithless institution, and took advantage of its preoccupation with the Mandalorian Wars to stage a revolution in the Kanz sector, renaming it the Argazdan Redoubt.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_PASSEL_ARGENTE,A Koorivar who served as the Magistrate of the Corporate Alliance, Passel Argente also served as the Galactic Senate representative of his home world of Kooriva.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_PRE_VIZSLA,Pre Vizsla was the leader of Death Watch, which sought to restore Mandalore to its old warrior ways instead of the pacifist manner it had adopted under the New Mandalorians.

During the Clone Wars he constantly sought to provoke the Republic to “invade” Mandalore and thus allow Death Watch to intervene and appear as liberators, but these plots constantly failed. Vizsla would later collaborate with the renegade Sith Lord Darth Maul in hopes of using him to achieve his goals.

Dudbed The Revanchist by the media, Revan and their followers helped turn the tide of the war, breaking the Mandalorian ranks at Malachor V and killing Mandalore The Ultimate, forcing the remainder to surrender or flee across the galaxy. Hailed as heroes, Revan and their loyalists then disappeared from the known galaxy, in search of a mysterious power in the Unknown Regions.

Revan's new persona was then enlisted in the Republic military, but a Sith attack led to Revan gathering a party on Taris to save Bastila. After escaping to Dantooine, Revan received Jedi training and unlocked their former Force potential. They were then sent on a journey to find the location of the Star Forge to stop the Sith.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SCYK_HEAVY_FIGHTER,The M3-A Scyk was a basic fighter produced by MandalMotors for semilegitimate organizations such as the Zann Consortium or the Hutt Cartels. The Scyk was just dangerous enough to be worthwhile without drawing the attention of MandalMotors Imperial supervisors, with its cheap price and variable weapon mounts making it popular on secondary markets even after production ceased. Heavier variants of the Scyk feature marginally improved durability and slugthrower cannons paired with a concussion missile launcher.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUBJUGATOR,A powerful battleship based around a specific heavy weapon. It was designed during the Clone Wars and is one of the largest vessels to come out of CIS shipyards. It is able to threaten entire battle groups by itself. Vessels of this class are typically armed with broadside Ion Pulse cannons though other configurations exist.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUBO,A minor crime lord who reigned on the fringes of the Outer Rim, Subo was an art collector who considered himself a Hutt of refined tastes. He grew interested in the lost planet of Endelaan, believing something there could prolong his life indefinitely so that he could inherit his fellow Hutts holdings. Subo attempted to bribe the crew of the Spiral Dancer for information on it, but the ships crew would escape his clutches.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUN_GUARD,One of the most feared mercenary units in the galaxy, originally formed by Thyrsian special forces units revolting against the Echani Command, before being subverted into a Sith Cult over the centuries. They are geared towards heavy personal combat and are very effective at engaging other infantry, fortifications and light targets but do lack for heavy anti-vehicle capabilities like the Mandalorian infantry they rival and individually surpass.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TANK,Combination assault vehicle and missile artillery known for rather impressive durability. The aptly named "Super Tank" packs MTT thickness armor and an impressive shielding system into the frame of a heavy tank, at the cost of logistical strain and overburdened repulsorlifts. Can engage targets as an artillery piece from range or a frontline assault tank depending on the current tactical situation, being individually effective at both, but not to the degree of groups of more dedicated assets.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VI,An armed version of the obsolete Super Transport VI armed with makeshift concussion missile launchers attached via external modular pods. A light shield was also added to increase durability under fire. This  resulted in a vessel which was better than nothing in battle and could maybe fend off some minor pirate attacks but worse than any dedicated combat ship.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VI_CARGO,Considered severely out of date by the time of the Galactic Civil War, most of these old massive cargo ships had been replaced by newer models of the KDY Super Transport series by the time of the Battle of Endor. A handful persisted in use around the galaxy although mainly in the hands of pirates who used the large vessel as mobile staging grounds for their raids.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VI_CARGO_SHIELD,Shields: Unshielded
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VI_HULL,Hull: 600 (Corvette)
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VI_MISSILE,Super Transport VI hull loaded with torpedo stocks to serve as an often sacrificial missile boat for desperate battles or owners. Can output a respectable amount of damage but will not survive under fire.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VII,A KDY Super Transport VII Bulk Cruiser modified to be better protected against pirate raids. Laser emplacements along the hull were added to allow the transport to defend itself against fighter attacks while the addition of ion cannons allowed it to try to fend off larger attackers. Weak shielding was also added to the vessel to provide it some additional protection over its civilian grade hull.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VII_CARGO,Smaller than their predecessor, the KDY  Super Transport VII could still carry an impressive 2 million metric tons of cargo. To maximise cargo carrying capacity the base design was slow, unshielded, and unarmed making them extremely easy prey for pirates.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VII_HULL,Hull: 650 (Corvette)
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VII_INTERDICTOR,A version of the KDY Super Transport VII refitted with a single gravity well generator in its cavernous holds to create a makeshift interdictor. Such an expensive investment also warranted the addition of lasers for self defence so it was not entirely helpless.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VII_MISSILE,Standard Super Transport VII loaded with assault missiles to serve as an emergency or cheap fire support platform. While hard-hitting at range it can not expect to survive the attention of even a small proper warship with much success.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI,Seeing the adhoc armed refits of the older Super Transport models in response to pirate raids, KDY created their own armed variant of the Super Transport XI. Quad laser cannons were dotted around the hull to provide all round protection from fighter attacks that were frequently a key element in pirate attacks. The token shields of the base cargo design were also heavily reinforced to allow the ship to withstand minor attacks. This redesign turned a once helpless ponderous giant into a nasty surprise for attackers.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI_CARGO,A giant KDY freighter capable of holding 25 million metric tons of cargo, a single Super Transport XI can take the place of hundreds of freighters. However this cargo capacity was obtained through the sacrifice of shields, weapons, and engine power. Thus this lumbering beast of a transport is suitable only for the safest routes or routes with sizable escorts. Records show that on occasion enterprising individuals have been witnessed refitting the Super Transport in unexpected ways.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI_CARGO_SHIELD,Shields: Unshielded
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI_HULL,Hull: 2345 (Frigate)
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI_MISSILE,Super Transport XI filled with a variety of munitions as a cheap, makeshift missile cruiser. While the size allows space for a respectable amount of firepower that can hurt even larger ships when unmolested, focus on the vessel by strikecraft or other cruisers will quickly result in its destruction.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI_MODIFIED,KDY's Super Transports are unarmed, lightly constructed cargo containers, but have a surprisingly rich history as makeshift combat support units.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SWIFTSURE,An advancement off the original concept vessel for the Inexpugnable-class, refitted following suggestions from Saul Karath by Rendili/Vanjervalis designers such as an advanced communications system. The Swiftsure-II compared to its origins would become a mass production model under the Republic Navy, acting as a smaller scale command vessel in areas its cousin design would be impractical to use. Featuring improved shielding and proton torpedoes compared to the original, the Swiftsure-II is a formidable vessel able to take on most threats of the era outside larger battlecruisers on its own.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SWIFTSURE_PDF,Inspired by the archaic Audacious-class, the Swifsure-I is based off the small-scale concept design for the Inexpugnable-class from where it received its name. Its general deployment was extremely limited due to the Navy favoring a larger design for the Inexpugnable, leaving the Swiftsure a rare sight until refits saw it mass produced in greater numbers. While uncommon, the Swiftsure-I retains an armament befitting an intended command ship, and should not be underestimated.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAA,Built on mass during the dying period of the Clone Wars, the Mankvim was a light and cheap interceptor which made up for its bad armour and weak weaponry with high speed and numbers. Their short range limited them to planetary defence or carrier operations. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAB,Pairing swarm fighters, Vultures, with swarm bombers, Hyenas, was a cheap and efficient way of dominating the battle space. With sheer numbers, even if a few are shot down, the payload was still delivered and the damage was done.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAC,The Confederacy preferred to establish fighter supremacy through the weight of sheer numbers. Vulture droid fighters were proven to be highly effective in this role. While the Vultures tied down and surrounded enemy fighters, Scarab fighters were able to clean up dogfights and clear the battle space.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAD,In order to support their own capital ships and deal with the Republic’s fleets, the CIS grouped long range fire support ships, such as the ion equipped Munifex, or the turbolaser focused Marauder, together to help whittle down shields and hull of enemy vessels.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAE,In order to rapidly deploy fighters and bombers to establish fighter superiority, the Trade Federation’s C-9979 Carrier was extensively used throughout the Clone Wars by the Confederacy. In order to escort the fragile carrier in hostile space, the Techno Union provided Hardcell missile boats to provide some protection.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAF,In order to protect their larger ships and escort bomber squadrons, the Confederacy organised small wolf packs of anti-fighter Diamond corvettes with Gozanti flotillas accompanying the corvettes to herd enemy fighters and bombers into range of the Diamond’s extensive rapid laser batteries.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAG,Mercenary groups often have access to surprisingly powerful equipment and since the CIS corporations can afford the exorbitant prices, the mercenaries were happy to lend their aid in a variety of engagements. These mercenaries were contracted to provide fighter and bomber support where ordered.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAH,A Planet with divided Loyalties in the war, a significant number of Mandalorians would contract themselves to the CIS despite the neutral status of their homeworld. Some would just be single warriors in search of a payday but lots would band together into mercenary groups or join as an entire Clan. These latter groups would also bring with them their own fighters and gunships which could be used to aid CIS fleets against the growing fighter strength of the Republic Navy. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAI,Before the Clone Wars, the Trade Federation commissioned KDY to build them ships they could use to combat pirate threats. When the Clone Wars broke out, the Trade Federation provided their extensive stockpile of Captor class carriers and  Auxilia class frigates to the Confederacy’s war effort.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAJ,Kolivex corvettes, designed by Geonosian PDF engineers, provided effective point defence against enemy ordnance. In order to help defend the corvette and other ships, Nantex fighters could be launched from the Kolivex.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAK,The small Hardcell tenders can provide support for allied fighter swarms and bombers, but they are fragile. In order to protect the Hardcells, CIS high command assigned Lupus Missile Frigates.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAL,All across the galaxy, planets utilised the ubiquitous Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser by Rendili for defence against any number of threats. Often these ships would be backed up by smaller, more agile corvettes. When the Clone Wars broke out and spread throughout the galaxy, these planetary defence forces got rolled into the Confederacy’s proper naval forces as valuable assets.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAM,In addition to providing loans and funding to the Confederacy, the Intergalactic Banking Clan also contributed significant military force to the Confederacy Navy, primarily in the form of well armed, though fragile, Munificent Communications ships and the Recusant class destroyers.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAN,Mercenary groups often have access to surprisingly powerful equipment and since the CIS corporations can afford the exorbitant prices, the mercenaries were happy to lend their aid in a variety of engagements. This group was contracted to provide heavy firepower support in a variety of engagements.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAP,As the Clone Wars dragged on, the CIS needed to update their fighters to compete with the Republic’s rapid R&D. The Tri-Fighter proved effective as an interceptor when paired with the Vulture swarms that could easily tie down the enemy.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAQ,The Belbullab fighter and bomber loadouts proved to be rather deadly in the right hands, capable of dishing out more damage and soaking more damage than their swarm counterparts, these fighters and bombers would be deployed by the CIS in more dangerous battle spaces.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAR,Mercenary groups often have access to surprisingly powerful equipment and since the CIS corporations can afford the exorbitant prices, the mercenaries were happy to lend their aid in a variety of engagements. The entire mercenary fleet was contracted to provide full support for the forces engaged in this battle.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAS,In order to break down enemy defences, a siege force requires significant supplies. The DH Omni ship can resupply major forces while the surprisingly manoeuvrable Lucrehulk Core Destroyer and Ginivex fighters defend the cumbersome supply vessel.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAT,The Recusant droid ship, and the larger dreadnought variant, were both designed to provide significant fire support from a distance. They can pepper heavy fire into enemy lines from across a battle space and should enemy fighters or bombers attempt to flank them, they have supplemental lasers to defend themselves.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAU,Engagements requiring a smaller, but still powerful force proved to be the perfect place to pair the deadly ship-to-ship firepower of the Bulwark with the heavy carrier/destroy hybrid Providence.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAV,Having significant firepower from the many ordnance launch bays at the prow of the ships, the Providence C/D and the larger Providence Dreadnoughts could fill many fleet roles and were capable of operating independently given their significant hangar capacity.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAW,To compete with larger and deadlier Republic ships of the late Clone Wars, the CIS took the Bulwark design and improved upon it, creating an even larger and deadlier vessel that could stand toe-to-toe against enemy capital ships.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAX,Lucrehulk Battlecarriers proved very effective in deterring enemy assaults due to how much firepower they could soak before getting severely damaged. As such they provided the perfect escort to the more fragile, Munificent. These ships could help protect the Lucrehulk from direct assault while the Lucrehulk soaked enemy firepower.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAY,The Lucrehulk Battleship traded some of its internal hangar capacity for a much stronger direct firepower loadout of turrets and turbolasers. When assigned to accompany Providence Dreadnoughts and Recusant Dreadnoughts, the resulting firepower and still significant fighter and bomber complement proved to be a powerful fleet to be reckoned with.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAZ,The Subjugator’s heavy ion cannon proved effective in engagements, but the lack of any support fleet showed a major weakness to bomber assaults. In order to rectify this oversight, the CIS assigned smaller vessels to accompany future Subjugator class ships on any missions. Auxilias and Captors provide excellent fire support and some protection against enemy bombers. Recusants could keep enemy ships at bay long enough for the ion cannon to do its work.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AIR_RAIDER,Both the HMP and MAF are devastating Gunships for the CIS with high mobility and firepower. They are able to pick and choose their fights, able to run from anything they cannot kill easily. BX Commando teams hitching a lift on the MAF gunships are able to quickly land and secure any gains made by the roaming gunships and potentially even securing a forward base for the CIS. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_ANTI_AIR_BATTERY,While many of the CIS ground assets are capable of some levels of anti air fire, the sheer variety and quantity of Republic airspeeders ranging in capability from the LAAT to the Gaba demands the deployment of a dedicated anti air vehicle where Republic air assets are expected. These important vehicles are weak to a ground attack and are frequently assigned a ground escort to ensure their protection from raids or at least fend off the attack long enough for the HAMLs to retreat back to protection. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_ARMOUR_ASSAULT,The Protodeka is one of many examples of CIS super vehicle designs that never went into mass production. A devastating force alone let alone supported by the firepower of Magna Tri droids and Hailfires. This force can easily overwhelm most Republic positions with ease. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_ARTILLERY,The HAG-M is the CIS indirect artillery vehicle capable of providing long range devastating fire from safety. The J-1 conversely is a direct fire artillery piece capable of providing heavy hits against large targets in line of sight. BX Commando Snipers can sometimes be attached to provide spotting and fire correction back to the artillery pieces.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_B1_DETACHMENT,The B1, the main infantry of the CIS, is a cheap, flimsy, mass produced combat droid that is really only effective when deployed in mass where the sheer weight of fire from massed carbines can compensate for all its flaws. A repair droid squad is attached to make a token attempt to keep the droid numbers up and reduce combat attrition.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_DEBT_COLLECTION_FORCE,The vast majority of the forces of the CIS came from the private pre-war security forces of several corporations. While meant for “protection” from pirates, these forces were often used to intimate others into securing their business interests or collect perceived debts owed to the megacorporations. Persuader tanks were geared especially towards this task and then repurposed towards shock assaults in the Clone wars. They often were accompanied with Hailfires whose fragile frame often needed protection from attack whilst their missiles rained destruction down any resistance. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_DESTROYER_FORMATION,Destroyer Droids were some of the most feared types of the commonly seen CIS droid infantry types due to their high speed, heavy firepower, and shield generators. The Mk2 version is an even more deadly version with even more guns and ion cannons. A strike force of destroyer droids is lethal to any infantry and even small vehicles with the mass of blaster fire. LR-57 droids lumber behind the nimble destroyers to secure the positions devastated in their wake, freeing up the destroyers to move on to a new target.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_HEAVY_INFANTRY,The B2 is a straight upgrade to the standard B1 design but would never fully replace the B1 in service due to the ease of mass production for the b1. This stronger droid can be supported in combat with the cheaper B1s which have been given better weapons than just massed carbine fire. This pairing has much more firepower and durability than the normal B1 formation. Infantry however tend to be slow and thus PACs are often deployed to carry infantry rapidly forward into the battle.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_HUNTER_KILLER,While the vast majority of CIS infantry forces were massed B1 droids, not all CIS droids were low quality and there were lots of higher quality designs. The Crab droid and Destroyer droids are both fast infantry droids with lots of protection and firepower which can react to threats around the battlefield and support the cheap slow B1s.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_INFILTRATION_TEAM,The BX series Commando Droids are highly expensive but mobile infiltration droids used as special forces for the CIS. Attached Mechanised Assault Flyers allow for even more mobility by acting as a gunship transport for the Commando Droids.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_LIGHT_ARMOUR,Both the GAT and OG-9 are glass cannon vehicles which are highly mobile, pack lots of firepower, but cannot take much damage in return. These glass cannon designs can retreat to the slow bulk of an MTT as a shield from heavy return fire thus acting as a secure pivot point for the more mobile vehicles. This highly mobile force can hit any Republic weak point and retreat from overwhelming enemy presence.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_MANDO_MERCENARY,Not all forces that took part in the Clone Wars were associated with either major faction. Such times of strife allowed many groups to sell their services to the highest bidder. While the government of Mandalore may have remained officially neutral in the conflict, not all Mandalorians accepted this pacifism but sought to maintain their old warlike ways even if it meant fighting other’s wars. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_MEDIUM_ARMOUR,AATs and Persuader tanks were the common tanks deployed by the CIS and in a large number they are capable of overwhelming most opposition especially when escorted by decent quality infantry. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_RECON,STAPs are the CIS version of a speeder bike and their job is to scout out the enemy. When the hostiles have been located the STAP will harass to pin down the enemy to pin and delay enemy forces while heavier forces are brought up although weak forces of infantry can be eliminated by a concentrated swarm of STAPs. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_TRADE_FED_ARMOUR_FORCE,Sometimes the deployment of MTTS and their stowed infantry is not enough to overwhelm enemy positions. In those cases the formation can easily be bolstered with the attachment of several AATs to provide additional firepower from behind the safety of the B1 swarm and mass of the MTTs
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_TRADE_FED_INFANTRY_FORCE,The MTT was a large troop transport that could bring masses of folded up B1s into a battle and then support them with their long range lasers. The appearance of MTTs on any battlefield heralded the deployment of swarms of CIS battle droids. On occasion heavier infantry types like destroyers droids would be transported along as well to supplement the power of the infantry. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_WALKER_ASSAULT,The Magna Tri droid is a large combat walker deployed by the CIS to deal with heavy vehicle threats or crush fortified positions. A swarm of B1 Droids protect it from any close range infantry support while OG-9s pour additional fire on the enemy from the relative safety behind the Magna Tri Droids.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAA,Not all forces that took part in the Clone Wars were associated with either major faction. Such times of strife allowed many groups to sell their services to the highest bidder. While the government of Mandalore may have remained officially neutral in the conflict, not all Mandalorians accepted this pacifism but sought to maintain their old warlike ways even if it meant fighting other’s wars.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAB,The Hutt are long lived and slow to reproduce. So not only do they believe themselves above the need to be common foot soldiers out of egotism, there is also a practical reason for this aversion. Why risk the precious life of a true hutt when the life of one of the many worthless slave and client races can take on all the risk of being frontline infantry. Their numbers form the core of any Hutt military ground operation and are commonly used to screen for more valuable pieces of equipment or for the rare occasions when lesser Hutts take to the field themselves. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAC,Speeders are very common and popular amongst the various humanoid client races under the Hutts for their extreme speed and manoeuvrability and their ability to armed with weapons stronger than what a regular soldier could carry over the same distances, including disruptors for those not caring about Galactic norms. While this mobility is useful for reconnaissance ahead of any regular ground forces, it also allows for hit and fade tactics to be used on the enemy to pin them in place and attrite their forces down if used judiciously. A careless commander however can easily get these speeder forces massacred if they overcommit or are careless as the pilots of these vehicles have next to no protection from enemy fire.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAD,Hutt society generally looks down upon Hutts who sully themselves by serving as somewhat regular infantry rather than just throwing expendable slaves, mercenaries, or clients into the meat grinder. Even so these lesser Hutts are still considered to be far more valuable tactically and socially than the aforementioned alternatives and their lives are still somewhat valuable. The heavy suits of armour serve both to help keep these Hutts alive through the dangers of the battlefield while also allowing them to bring large amounts of firepower for infantry. They are also often accompanied by retinues of client or slave soldiers who serve both as “ablative armour” for the Hutts and also to stop the small formations of Hutt warriors for being swarmed by a foe almost certainly more numerous. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAE,With the vast amount of worlds the Hutts operate the terrain is often best described as rugged which makes repulsorlift and airborne vehicles very popular options for vehicular mobility. The Tape Skiff is their primary option for vehicle ground to air options with its many missile launchers. The Pongeeta Speeder is often tasked with escorting the Tape Skiffs to keep them safe from any infantry assault. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAF,The Hutt switch to active militarism left them in a position of having an underdeveloped military industrial complex and thus are forced to to rely on converted civilian designs, which on Hutt worlds have a tendency to be repulsorlift craft. The Bantha Skiff has light blasters suited to dealing with clusters of infantry while the Superhaul Skiff packs multiple anti-vehicle missile launchers to deal with hardened targets. In concert these highly mobile skiffs can appear out of nowhere and devastate small out of positioned formations while easily maintaining a safe distance from more formidable threats. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAG,These small flyers are routinely used by various Hutt groups to maintain aerial reconnaissance over important buildings and locations. In times of active conflict small groups of them are sent out ahead of the main bulk of Hutt forces to locate any enemy ground forces and constantly harass them until they are weakened enough for other Hutt forces to wipe out. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAH,As the intensity of warfare increases on the ground, so do the risk towards the Hutt lives who stoop to the level of actively engaging in combat. Their combat armour can only do so much to maintain their health whilst under a barrage of laser fire. Their slave soldiers only have so many lives to give for the sake of their masters. The allocation of Personnel IV Skiffs to such Hutt warbands provides a reasonable increase in firepower against opposing infantry forces but also it brings a significant amount of Bacta and other medical supplies to treat any injuries the Hutt Warriors may receive. If the local commander is feeling generous these medical supplies can also be used to treat casualties taken from the retinue of slave soldiers. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAI,Shell Hutts are a minority of the Hutt race who have dedicated their lives to wearing ever increasing sizes of power armour. This power armour is highly customised to suit each Hutt encased inside and virtually always includes multiple weapons systems attached to the armour’s frame. While these Minor Shell Hutts are still relatively small (for a Shell Hutt) they can still bring weapon systems more commonly seen on small and medium sized dedicated military vehicles. Their limited numbers does present a risk of getting swarmed in combat and thus these Hutts nearly always bring a high quality retinue for added protection such as the ancient wardroids once used by Xim the Despot which still somehow perform at good standard for wardroids despite their extreme age, a testament to their advanced construction and quality control millennia ago. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAJ,The rugged nature of the vast majority of Hutt worlds also informed their choice of tank in addition to their preference for Skiffs for their lighter vehicles. The WLO-5 repulsor tank which lacks the same levels of firepower of the mainline tanks used by the Republic and CIS but is noticeably more mobile. This allows the WLO-5 to attempt to dictate the pace of battle against a more ponderous foe while also allowing them to maintain formation with the swarms of smaller Skiffs utilised in a militarised role by the Hutts and thus mutually support each other. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAK,Minor Shell Hutts straddle the boundary between infantry and light vehicles due to their size and firepower but their numbers are few. One countermeasure employed by the Hutts to increase the survivability of these Shell Hutts is to provide retinues of soldiers or droids to provide extra numbers and screen for the Hutts. Another popular tactic is partner formations of Shell Hutts with gunships which can transport soldiers. The resilient VAAT/E is often entrusted to this role of safely delivering Shell Hutts to their designated targets, providing air support for their mission, and then exfiltrating them once the mission is completed or the enemy have managed to mobilise sufficient mass of force to properly threaten the lives of the Hutts on the ground. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAL,The ancient Hutt Empire was extremely expansionist which threw it into multiple wars. The one against Xim the Despot was near cataclysmic in its destruction and was a major factor for the Hutts turning away from such open militarism. However one major boon for the Hutts from the War was the capture of the warbot army utilised by Xim which was so advanced for their time that these warbots remain viable for deployment during the Clone Wars if the Hutts decide to reactive them for active service rather than keeping them reserved as statue guards for their Palaces.  
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAM,As the Hutts slowly return to their ancient militarism, they became more and more willing to take risks with the lesser Hutts who served as infantry in some forms. Their relatively small numbers made up for this by their natural resilience being heavily bolstered by powered armour, which also allows these Hutts to bring more firepower than a humanoid infantry soldier. Instead of relying on mobility or large retinues to protect them from being swarmed by large numbers of enemies, the Hutts are now willing to just bring more Hutts to the fight and deploy them in a solid mass where their qualitative superiority will compensate for their quantitative inferiority. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAN,The Hutt usage of the WLO-5 as their mainline tank has granted Hutt ground forces better mobility than their peers although combat experience has found that it has come at a cost of firepower. Some Hutt commanders attempt to compensate for this by attaching smaller Skiffs to companies of WLO-5s, the alternative popular organisational choice has been to subordinate batteries of MAL repulsor artillery platforms. The WLO-5 tanks are deployed ahead of the MALs to locate and pin enemy forces which then allows the MALs to deploy their missile launchers from the travel locks and then unleash a massive barrage upon the enemy. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAO,The Republic and the CIS deployed a wide range of gunships and flyers in their ground forces both for the deployment of troops and in ground attack roles. This influenced the Hutts to develop their own gunship formations in response with the VAAT/E gunships operating in concert with a small swarm of Hutt Atmospheric Flyers. The latter operate to spot targets and distract enemy anti air fire away from the latter which provides the bulk of the staying power and the optional ability to transport infantry along for the operation.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAP,The Gamorreans are formidable close range warriors with an axe or blaster pistol due to their bulk providing a lot of survivability when under fire in addition to the constant training encouraged by their native warrior culture. Personnel Skiffs IVs with medical supplies follow in the wake of the charging mass of Gamorreans to treat any injuries and rapidly return the wounded to fighting condition. The blasters on the Skiffs can also provide suppressing fire to assist the Gamorreans close into melee range with the enemy. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GROUNDWAR_HUTT_GW_AAQ,Once a civilian vessel that were luxurious status symbols of various Hutts, these Luxury sail barges have been commandeered and retrofitted to something approaching a military standard then given over as command vessels for local Hutt commanders. While these barges now bristle with weapons, they still pale in comparison to the heavy assault vehicles commonly deployed by the Republic and CIS and thus they nearly always have their own escort of repulsorlift tanks and skiffs in order to rapidly destroy the enemy. The militarisation of these barges also make them viable mass transports of infantry with all the living and work space dedicated for guests and slaves having been converted to space for the transport of slave soldiers and warrior Hutts into battle.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAA,The Z95 is an extremely common snub fighter for mercenary and other independent formations in the galaxy. This means the Hutts can easily hire cheap and disposable fighter squadrons to patrol and garrison areas of space where the Hutts do not bother to openly display their military might.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAB,For the last few millennia the Hutts have strove to minimise any image of them possessing conventional military capacity. Hence when small conflicts arise the Hutts will usually contract mercenaries to deal with the conflict and not all merc groups are equal in strength and focus. While they are still likely to be dependent on open market or older starfighter designs, some groups are able to form stronger formations capable of engaging and destroying corvettes and frigates on their own.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAC,The Minstrel series of Yachts are most commonly used as personal Yachts by individual Hutts which justified their relatively heavy weapon loadout for seemingly civilian ships. These armaments also mean that the minstrels can very easily be converted into purpose military corvettes when an actual conflict flares up enough for the Hutts to actually dedicate their real navy in response. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAD,The venerable Juvard frigate makes for the perfect patrol and picket frigate for the Hutts. It is strong and fast enough to deal with any pirates or mercenary groups who are foolish enough to operate against the Hutts or any unrest from the Hutt’s many client species; while also being old enough that no one who sees these dated vessels would fear the Hutts are starting to remilitarise. If needed the even older Kaloth Battlecruisers can be “generously donated” from loyal mercenaries and client races and attached to groups of Juvards to rapidly swell the numbers of frigates operating in an area.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAE,Successful mercenary groups, or at least those with wealthy and generous backers, are able to expand their operations to afford the acquisition and running maintenance cost of one or more corvettes. Cheap and widely produced corvettes tend to be the ones chosen by these groups and then heavily up-armed over their stock configurations. These groups can be contracted to rapidly expand the corvette forces of the Hutt Cartels without giving away their true military strength or can be used as a roving hunter killer formation used in support of conventional Hutt Navy deployments.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAF,While small grouping of Headhunter fighter squadrons are sufficient to deal with the demands of garrison duty or anti piracy patrols in backwater planets; two squadrons are insufficient to deal with the needs of any real conflict. When mercenaries are expected to be deployed in situations where such an elevated threat exists it has often proven prudent to contract additional squadrons of fighters. More Squadrons of Z95s provide the mass needed to engage and tie down snub fighters while heavier fighter types such as the highly modifiable Cloakshape can deploy additional firepower to rapidly destroy the hostiles. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAG,Independent groups who are adverse to taking losses or find themselves with requirements not suitable for mass deployment of fighter squadrons but are not wealthy to afford corvettes or larger ship tend to gravitate toward the various models of gunships that exist in the galaxy. The Gozanti raider refit provides extensive firepower in a small package allowing squadrons of these to successfully engage vessels much larger than themselves while the Mandalorian Kom'rk exists as a massively oversized fighter craft and occasionally transport. In tandem a wing of these gunships can successfully engage the vast majority of targets either for piracy or as long range raiders in warfare.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAH,The  Kuat Systems Engineering Morningstar picket fighter is a highly customisable design which meant that while it was intended for planetary defence forces it found favour in other groups such as various groups affiliated with the Hutts. The A variant was designed as a multirole craft able to engage other fighters with lasers or larger ships with missiles while the B variant drops the missile launchers for more and heavier laser cannons to specialise in dogfighting enemy fighters. The C variant sacrifices the majority of its ability to engage fighters in return for an expanded capability to engage capital ships.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAI,The Raka is a Hutt freighter model that was commonly converted to act as a fighter support vessel to allow for pilots to rest and their craft to be refueled and rearmed while away from base or a capital ship. This allows the Hutts to send groups of starfighters and gunships far beyond their normal range to harass the enemy logistical routes with multirole fighters commonly selected for this duty such as the A variant of the modular Morningstar or some of the more openly available versions of the new Y-wing Starfighter which can engage any enemy target such as freighters, their escorting fighters, corvettes, or frigates. The ancient Mandalorian Kell Gunship can be used as a cheap gunship to bolster the survivability and firepower of these raiding task forces.  
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAJ,The Rendili StarDrive Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser was a near ubiquitous ship amongst planetary government defense fleets due to its cheap cost and ease of use. Because of this, it is extremely easy for Hutt Cartels to source these vessels to rapidly bolster their nascent naval presence although the vast majority of these vessels would be the relatively under-gunned variants that predate the outbreak of hostilities in The Clone Wars. Due to urgency at which the Hutts need mid sized capital hulls in service; the majority of DHCs deployed remain in this weaker state due to a lack of time to complete refits although to compensate for this lack, one DHC in every trio deployed is the massively upgunned Gunboat variant as a stopgap measure.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAK,While the undergunned “PDF” Dreadnaught Heavy Cruisers are being brought and rushed out as a stop gap measure, Hutt naval yards are busily producing their own licensed production version of the DHC which matches contemporary wartime standards in the Ubrikkian Cruiser as their standard mass produced mid sized warship. Observations of the fighter heavy nature of the Clone Wars led to the doctrinal development to frequently deploy these cruisers alongside the natively developed Tempest Cruiser which lacks some of the firepower of the Ubrikkian design but has a more versatile weapons loadout and the capability to carry and deploy their own starfighter squadrons. This well rounded standard formation aims to be a building block for the rapidly developing Hutt navy to operate around.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAL,Seeing the increasing reliance on small to midsized vessels in the naval forces of their potential rivals, the Hutts developed the Szajin cruiser which relies on lots of rapid firing lighter turbolasers to deal its damage which necessitates very aggressive tactics when these ships are deployed. Operating in trios they can cooperate to more effectively close into range with taking a minimum of damage. The well rounded Kossak operate in pairs in the wake of the Szajins to fend off enemy snubfighter squadrons or finish off crippled vessels.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAM,An ancient standard Hutt formation composed of centuries old designs, a pair of Karagga Destroyers escorted by a small swarm Barabbula frigates can output a prodigious amount of anti capital ship missiles nearly certain to pierce through any point defence grids of Hutt opponents while barrages of turbolasers swat away the ships crippled by the missiles. Formations like these represent the naval power of the ancient Hutts which have been kept hidden away for millennia and now re released upon the galaxy.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAN,As the Hutts start to remilitarise and look outwards once again, their need to operate further and further away from their long established bases increases. This forced the Hutts to expand their supply of militarised merchant vessels which can transport a reasonable amount of supplies while having some ability to defend themselves from enterprising pirate or hostile powers interdicting supply lines. To this end an upgunned version of the iconic Galleon is commonly used while the ancient Juvard frigate has found a new lease on life as a convoy escort vessel for when the Hutt Galleons are operating in areas of increased risk. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAO,The intensity of the starfighter combat between the CIS and Republic has led the Hutt Cartels to invest in modernising their starfighter fleet beyond cheap mass market models and a reliance on mercenary contractors. The Dunelizard fighter is one of these new developments that the resurgent Hutt Navy started to field to escort its older Kusak bombers on their strike runs. The Dunelizard’s slugthrowers could engage enemy fighters to clear approaches for the slow Kusak squadrons or the Dunelizard’s proton torps can assist engaging with larger ships if enemy fighter cover was lacking.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAP,The Scyk Fighter line is also a relatively new adoption into the Hutt Navy as a lightly armed fast interceptor used on mass to protect spaceborne assets or sweep the local area for any enemy squadrons. However the lack of firepower of the Scyk means that Hutt commanders often partner them with squadrons operating heavier fighters such as the Cloakshape; still used despite the Hutts attempts to switch to domestic production over open market imports due to its extreme versatility and availability.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAQ,Using converted Raka Freighters as fighter tenders, it is possible for the Hutts to send long range snubfighter and gunship raids deep behind enemy lines. A wide range of craft are often chosen for these operations althought there are a prefrence for those with multirole capablities over monotask designs to allow for the widest range of targets to be hit. Newer Krayt gunships can be sparingly found in these roles to boost the firepower of the formation alongside the older Kell gunships.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAR,Having seen the effectiveness of massed bombers in the engagements between the Republic and Cis, the Hutts experimented with a formation based around the expensive but well protected Scurrg heavy bomber. To ensure these valuable craft successfully made their attack runs it heavy gunships were assigned to be both their fighter escort and also provide supporting firepower against their capital ship targets. While this group of squadrons provides an disportionate amount of firepower to Hutt commanders, their deployments are limited due to the high cost of all the majority of the craft involved which heavily limits their aquistion and replacement.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAS,The Vontor is an extremely ancient design that has not been seen outside of the mysterious Bootana Hutta area of space for millennia. There the Hutts had conserved and concealed their true power until such a time the Hutts were truly threatened. With the outbreak of total galactic war due to the Clone Wars, the Hutts no longer feel safe exercising using only soft and criminal power. The Vontor provides the backbone of these newly released hidden fleets with the versatile Tempests providing support for the operations of the capital ships. Szajin Cruisers kept in reserve are sallied out to rapidly close down and exterminate ships decimated by the longer range firepower before returning the safety of the capital ships and their fighter cover.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAT,The heavy fighter variant of the Scyk was developed in response to opinions of the baseline fighter lacking enough firepower to be truely effective. These upgraded fighters are expected to be capable of providing fighter cover for the brand new Kimogila line of bombers. These new designs signal the Hutt’s shift away from a reliance on mercs and open market designs towards newer more capable models of fighters piloted by those recruited from the worlds under the sway of the Hutts.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAU,The Voracious is an extremely old Hutt design that has not been seen by the wider galaxy for millennia as they have been kept in reserve in Boonta Hutta in case the Hutts ever needed to restore its naval warfighting capabilities. Despite the design’s age and frailty, its cavernous hangar bays and long range heavy guns means it can still remain relevant as fleet support vessel. Swarms of Barabbula frigates are often attached to Voracious carriers to add their long range anti ship missiles to the carriers long range guns and keep any threatening ships at a distance. Vontor Destroyers are often assigned as a mutually supporting fleet element with Juvard frigates in tow. This element serves to keep the ancient and valuable carriers safe by interposing itself between them and any threat and also is capable of dealing with a wide range of threats even without the assistance of long range fire support and fighter sorties. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAV,The Dor’bulla is not just the largest warship fielded by the Hutts but it is also a statement of their wealth and power developed to safeguard Hutt space from the ever growing amount of battlecruiser sized ships developed in the prelude to the the Clone Wars. Despite its power and resilience, only foolish commanders operate such a valuable ship on its own. Karagga Destroyers can use the mass of the Dorbulla to shield themselves whilst barraging an enemy with wave after wave of ship-killing missiles. Fielding Szajin's forces an enemy to pick between the single giant threat or the group of small bundles of firepower in a cruiser hull, with Ubrikkian Cruisers operating as a balanced element able to provide their own firepower against enemy capital ships whilst providing decent laser fire to swat away enemy squadrons.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAW,The Ancient Hutts shied away from using open warfare with the realisation they could win a drawn out war of attrition against the short lived and faster reproducing races that composed the Old Republic and switched over to soft influence and criminal enterprises to maintain their place in the galaxy. With a return to a total war footing, the Hutts solved one element of their manpower problem by the conscription of their many client races to fill their manpower needs. Another method used was to pull all their criminal and mercenary contacts developed through millennia of careful patronage into a more centralised command structure allowing them to form flotillas and task forces from disparate groups that had used to operate on their own. This provides the Hutts a second massive pool of manpower which will constantly refill as long as Hutts are willing to invest the appropriate amount of credits.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAX,For millennia the Hutts have refuted open warfare as a viable form of wielding power for their species. For millennia the Hutts maintained the image of only interested in economic and criminal influence with the barest minimal applications of military force. For millennia the Hutts have been slowly preparing for the next outbreak of galactic war with ships slowly and covertly constructed for the Boonta Hutta fleets which locked down the secretive core of Hutt space. With no warfare for many generations of Hutts, development of new warships was a low priority and thus the vast majority of the vessels in the Boonta Hutta fleet are truly ancient designs which belay their true strength. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HUTTS_AAY,With the Hutts now truly militarised and investing into their own military, they have moved away from cheap open market designs like the Z95 Headhunter in all but the lowest priority sectors. The new Dunelizard Interceptor became a popular replacement fighter for the Hutts for high priority sectors due to its mix of survivability, manoeuvrability and decent anti fighter firepower.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_JEDI_STRIKE_TEAM,The Jedi are the protectors of the Republic and have served the Republic in its times of need for millennia. These elite Force-sensitives often found themselves in the hardest of fights and the most important locations of the war. An organized company of Jedi Knights consists of members of the Guardian, Consular, and Sentinel schools, each offering a unique skillset to bring into battle.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_LIGHT_WALKER,With their low profile and high speed, AT-PTs were a popular choice to deploy in small packs to hunt for enemy infantry although their lack of heavy firepower left them exposed to any armoured counter attack. The rare but highly effective AT-XT walker can form a small protective core for its smaller walker cushion to retreat behind in the case of the AT-PTs pack finding a target it cannot deal with itself.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_AIR_ASSAULT_BRIGADE, LAATs are the iconic and extremely common Republic gunship/lander and are used for many different mission roles including commando team insertions and close air support for the landed troops. HAETs abandon the massive troop bay of the LAAT for better sensors and a large gun making them perfectly suited for air support and reconnaissance.  
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_ANTI_AIR_BATTERY,Dedicated Anti Air vehicles such as the UT-AA served an important role during battle in protecting ground troops from the numerous gunships of the Confederates like the dreaded HMP. AT-RTs provide a light escort from any infiltrating infantry which seek to destroy the vehicles or provide early warning of a larger attack. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_ARTILLERY,Not all military formations operate on the frontline. The AV7 provides indirect fire support for lots of Republic ground operations with their long range shells able to devastate unprepared formations from relative safety at the rear of Republic battle lines. AT-APs range further forward using their long range mass drivers as direct-fire artillery pieces in support of troops although they are also capable of dealing with attacks on themselves with their other weapons. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_CLONE_AIRLANDING,In many operations during the Clone wars, Republic forces had to make hostile landings to clear out a beachhead for more forces to deploy. To this end the Gunship/transport hybrid LAAT/i is capable of landing small forces of Clones equipped for assault operations and then supporting them in combat as they storm the target and prepare it for follow on formations. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_CLONE_COMPANY,The Clone Army forms the main element of the Grand Army of the Republic with Clone trooper formations being able to be rapidly redeployed to meet the ever changing demands of the war. Often led into battle by a Jedi, Clones serve as the main infantry of the Republic. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_CLONE_P2_COMPANY,The roll out of Phase 2 Clone Armour took a while to complete but the new armour saw a noticeable improvement in the capabilities of the regular clone trooper. It also coincided with an increase of individualism in the clones. More capable than the purely identical clones that started the Clone wars, Clones still were the mainstay infantry of the Republic and were frequently led into battle by a Jedi. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_COMBAT_AIR_PATROL,The fast and light Gaba-18 Airspeeder is frequently used to rapidly scout out the combat theatre. If a threat is too great for the light guns of the Gaba, heavier assets can be called in as needed. The extremely fast and relatively heavily armed Flashblind airspeeder is frequently able to rapidly respond to requests for additional firepower from the forward recon assets as well as protecting them from aerial interception. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_HEAVY_MECHANISED,The A5 juggernaut was a fast and complex heavy assault vehicle that used its high speed and heavy firepower to storm enemy positions before unloading squads of Republic clone troopers to flush out any remaining enemy and then secure the position.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_HEAVY_WALKER,The AT-TE walker was the mainstay assault walker of the Grand Army of the Republic that saw service from the very start of the war and saw service in nearly every major ground battle. It was frequently and best deployed alongside large groups of clones in mutual support of each other. The AT-OT is the inverse of the AT-TE, losing some of the weaponry and armour of the AT-TE but gaining a lot more room for cargo or passengers. When not deployed in a rear line logistical role, the AT-OT can transport a large amount of clones safely to the frontlines where they can dismount into combat.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_LIGHT_MECHANISED,The Juggernaut series of vehicles are intended for assaulting enemy formations and often did this while carrying their own escorting infantry in their large cargo bays. The heavy infantry carried by these large vehicles can either be used to bolster the considerable firepower of this family of assault vehicles or to hold the land taken by its charge from any counter attack.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_MANDO_MERCENARY,Not all forces that took part in the Clone Wars were associated with either major faction. Such times of strife allowed many groups to sell their services to the highest bidder. While the government of Mandalore may have remained officially neutral in the conflict, not all Mandalorians accepted this pacifism but sought to maintain their old warlike ways even if it meant fighting other’s wars. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_PATHFINDERS,The Phase 2 Armour program improved heavily on the original clone trooper armours in many regards. Perhaps most importantly for the ARC troopers was its ease of customizability giving them even more freedom to specialise for their mission. Alongside the effective Biker Advanced Recon Commando Speeder, these Advanced Reconnaissance Commandos are an elite and fast strike force.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_PDF_ASSAULT,Equipped with light weight rapid fire weapons, PDF assault squads are tasked with capturing enemy locations in close quarter battle or finishing off enemy formations pinned by the fire of line formations. The attached medic squad helps to keep the poor quality PDF soldiers alive. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_PDF_LINE,Expected only to protect Republic planets from low level threats or failing that, delaying the enemy until more forces of Grand Army of the Republic can be deployed; These PDF Squads are equipped with heavy weapons intended to provide a solid base of fire to pin enemy threats. Attached SD-6 infantry Hulk Droids provide some extra firepower and protection to the low quality PDF soldiers. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_RECON,Fast 74-Z Speeder bikes scout out the land in preparation for the enemy and to give information allowing following on formations to deploy in best fashion. AT RTs provide a core of firepower to help rescue any scouts that get heavily engaged.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_REPULSOR_ASSAULT,While walkers were a highly popular design choice for the Grand Army of the Republic, it was recognised that walkers could not fill every role and terrain type. Repulsorlift vehicles were often used in terrain not able to take the weight of the walkers. The UT AT provides heavy firepower for the more mobile Saber fighter tanks to operate around while the ISP run escort to protect the tanks from infantry attack. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_SPEARHEAD,The A6 Juggernaut is an even larger and stronger version of the A5 and one of the largest and strongest ground vehicles fielded during the Clone Wars by the Republic. Expensive and prone to breakdowns, it tended to only see service in the most important theatres of the war. An A6 alone is a mighty threat on the battlefield. An A6 flanked with several A5s could easily roll over all but the strongest position. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_SPECIAL_FORCES_TEAM,ARC troopers are the best of the best of Clone troopers but are extremely small in numbers. Clone Commandos are a midpoint between the one man army ARCs and the regular Clone troopers but are still formidable in their combat ability. Working together ARCs and Commandos make for an extremely formidable force capable of devastating surgical strikes. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAA,The Delta 6 was a short ranged and stripped down interceptor designed for usage by the Jedi Order whose force powers could make best use of light weight design and negate its weaknesses. This stripped down nature made it extraordinarily cheap which also made it a popular acquisition for several Planetary Defence Forces even if normal pilots struggled to make best use of its design. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAB,The V-19 was a fighter design rushed into service at the start of the Clone Wars to provide a standard fighter for Clone Pilots. Jedi were also pressed into military service during the Clone Wars where they often preferred to lead their force’s fighters from the front while piloting their Delta 7 fighters
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAC,While the clones were the most visible aspect of Republic Military Forces, the vast majority were non clones. Fighter groups formed from the Planetary Defence Forces and then rotated to active duty into the Republic Navy were common. The Z95 Headhunter was a popular choice for PDF groups due to their versatility, low cost for their performance, and high availability. Headhunters converted into bombers provide the Strike Wing with a lot more firepower against larger targets while more standard Headhunters seek out hostile fighters.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAD,One of the few fighters commonly used by the Republic which had an inbuilt hyperdrive, the Aggressive Reconnaissance Starfighter 170 was intended to reach behind enemy lines to rapidly strike and destroy vulnerable facilities. To do this the ARC had strong lasers and proton torpedoes to rapidly deal damage while a manned turret compensated for the slower speed and lower agility of the design. In addition to its intended role the ARC170 was also used by the Republic as a heavy fighter in traditional battle. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAE,Y wings were the primary bomber used by the Starfighter pilots in the Republic Navy. Despite being heavily armoured and possessing a defence turret, they were not trusted to go into combat alone against any target possessing decent fighter coverage unless there were no available fighters to escort them which could often happen due to the Y wing possessing a hyperdrive while most Republic fighters lacked one. As the standard fighter for the early war Republic, the V-19s often were tasked with such escort even when more modern fighters started to appear for the Republic as the war progressed. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAF,The CIS employed massed fighter tactics in nearly all its battles which prompted the Republic to employ lots of its smaller ships in anti fighter roles such to provide a protective picket for the larger vessels. CR90s and LACs were commonly employed in such roles due to their modularity which allowed for easy conversions of weapons loadouts.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAG,Carracks served in many Planetary Defence Forces before the Clone Wars started which meant that when the war started large numbers of them were available to be folded into the Republic Navy. In war time service they were often formed into wolf packs where their concentrated heavy turbolasers fire could be devastating for ships much larger than themselves. While their own lasers provided some defence against the swarms of CIS fighters, some commanders provided fighter cover launched from the old Class-C frigate which can also provide more protection against smaller vessels. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAH,Small groups of fast multipurpose frigates were frequently kept in reserve by commanders to act as small-scale rapid reaction task forces for when patrolling elements encountered hostile enemies, or to quickly reinforce larger ships which were engaged in battle. Both the Victory 1 Frigate and Arquitens possess the speed needed for this role along with the versatile array of weaponry to reasonably engage any enemy forces they are called to face.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAI,As the war progressed the Republic found it necessary to bolster local PDF forces which were under threat from the CIS or the rising pirate threat. T.I.E Starfighters were a relatively cheap but capable fighter that was also easy for pilots to fly. This resulted in the Republic purchasing large quantities of the fighter not old to fill up hangar capacity of older less prioritised warships but also to aid the defences of loyal planets. Despite never being in the limelight like other Clone Wars fighters, the growing numbers of T.I.Es along with their effectiveness would help influence the decisions of the later Empire to base their fighters on the design's successor.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAJ,As the Clone Wars progressed, more and more planets decided to take their local defences more seriously. As a result many of them sought to increase the quantity and quality of their starfighter forces as many of them had relied on cheap, good enough fighters. Unable to simply replace all their fighters in an instant, many used squadrons of better quality fighters to bolster a wing of cheaper fighters where it could act as a centre point of the formation. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAK,The quality of fighters and bombers possessed by a Planetary Defence Force could vary wildly. While some only had token defensive forces which would likely not resist any determined threat, other planets took their own defence more seriously and sought out better quality forces which could actually hurt any attacker. Despite their unpopularity in the Republic Navy, The H60 Tempest would find its way into the service of such planets as a capable bomber was far better than no bomber craft at all. The ever reliable Cloakshape was a popular choice for planets as it was easily available and highly customisable to match their needs such as escorting the bombers to their target. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAL,Large numbers of corvettes would be produced during the Clone Wars as these small but capable vessels were able to be built in vast numbers compared to the larger warships which gave the Republic the ability to disperse them for the regular duties of war such as patrols and escorts. However at times large numbers of corvettes could be concentrated into a single spot which represents a deceptively high amount of firepower. Such wolf packs of corvettes are a lethal threat to any vessel if injured or otherwise deceptive and their speed and small size allows them to rapidly relocate during the battle to take advantage of any such opportunities. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAM,The venerable Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser was a near ubiquitous warship across the Republic, both in the Republic Navy and Planetary Defence Forces. The ones frequently found in the service of PDFs were often of lower quality and lacking in the weaponry compared to their Naval cousins, although planets did take modernisation programs during the war to rectify this deficit such as by converting the unused spaces in their Dreadnaughts into hangar bays which could then be used to carry fighters and bombers. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAN,Designed as a troop transport for the Republic’s secret Clone Army, the Acclamator was built on mass and was rapidly forced into other roles especially early in the war where other warships were not available to the Republic Navy in any suitable numbers. Thus the Acclamator became a warship with multiple variants where it could serve in roles such as a backline carrier or frontline brawler. Battle groups of Acclamators could be found through the duration of the Clone Wars in reflection of the capability and versatility their design proved to have. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAO,Both designs were often used for long-duration patrol and assault missions, the contradictory weapon loadouts and combat characteristics of the block-1 Imperial and Gladiator series frigates work well together. Each provides different firepower and support while being relatively fast vessels, allowing them to engage near any target type when covering the other’s weakness.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAP,The Dreadnaught Heavy Cruisers which ended up in the service of the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars were often far better armed and of a better quality in general then the ones remaining in the service of the Planetary Defence Forces. The massive amounts of DHCs made in the decades preceding the Clone Wars resulted in them being the backbone warships of the Republic, especially in the early periods of the war where newer designs were only just starting to be designed or enter service. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAQ,The V-wing became the premier fighter in the service of the Republic during the last year of the war where swarms of the highly capable fighter were sent to destroy any and all fighters sent out by the CIS. The Jedi largely maintained their early war habit of leading from the front in their fighters although their Delta 7 was largely replaced by the highly advanced Eta-2 Actis by this period of the war. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAR,The NTB-630 found life as a heavy bomber for the Republic during the Clone Wars where it was extensively used to bring large amounts of ordinance on CIS targets. The Z-95 was also adopted by the Republic and received extensive modifications into a highly deadly fighter that could be used either to escort the heavy bombers to their target or join them in their attack runs with their own proton torpedoes. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAS,As the Clone Wars progressed, the Republic's tactics adapted as the need for anti-fighter protection from corvettes decreased due to the vast increase in the number and capability of Republic fighters. Furthermore the CIS often attempted to hunt down these corvettes with their own small vessels. This reduced the size of the Republic picket groups along with resulting in less specialised corvettes being dedicated to the task force to provide protection against CIS raiders. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAT,As the Class-C frigate fell out of favour and was seen in fewer numbers their role as support for Carrack Wolf Packs had to be replaced with a frigate that existed in greater numbers. The mass produced Pelta Assault variant fell into this role as although it lacked a hangar, it had sufficient lasers and point defence systems which allowed it to provide anti fighter protection for the carracks along with battling smaller corvettes which challenged the task force.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAU,Gunships were a popular choice for Planetary Defence Forces which require a cheap long range defence option. Skiprays were a durable platform which combined a large array of weapons which allowed it to engage any threat found while the Citadel focused mainly on combating the CIS fighters. Together, squadrons of these Gunships were able to go on long range missions from their base and engage any threat encountered or survive long enough to call in reinforcements. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAV,One of the main weaknesses of the standard Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser Line was their weakness to CIS fighters and bombers due to the lack of their own hangars and laser weaponry. Thus in order to rectify this weakness in the standard formation, carrier conversion of the PDF DHCs were requisitioned to supplement the cruiser line with some fighter cover and some bombers to project power further out from the formation. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAW,Neutron Stars were freighters rapidly converted into warships in order to fulfil the massively increased demand for convoy escorts which resulted from the Clone Wars. When needed they could also transport their own supplies in addition to being the escorts for other logistical vessels such as the Pelta, another wartime design frequently used to transfer people and supplies to the frontline. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAX,The Victory Fleet was the first and main republic Fleet to get the new Victory Class Star Destroyers alongside the Gladiator Star Destroyer which had been specifically designed to escort the Victory. The Fleet was primarily broken up into two main task forces although even smaller sub formations would be detached where needed. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAY,The Venator Star Destroyer was the backbone capital ship of the Republic Navy due to its versatile nature, large capacity for ground units or fighters, and no obvious weaknesses. This versatility also made the Venator an ideal core for task forces as it could cover all possible threats with one design while just adding more ships to increase the fleet strength. Groups of Venators often made the spearhead of Republic invasion fleets to clear local space of enemies while Acclamators followed in their wake to deliver more ground troops. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAZ,The Victory Star Destroyer packed an impressive array of weapons and ordnance but did suffer from a lack of speed which could allow for enemy forces to disengage and flee. The Acclamator II transforms the once troop carrier into a rapid and deadly vessel which can saturate ships or planets in turbolaser fire. When paired with the slow Victory the relatively nimble Acclamators could chase down and finish wounded prey. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ABA,Designed during the Clone wars but suffered from issues during their introduction, The Imperator Star Destroyer and its sister design the Tector Star Destroyer saw limited service in the war. Both were designed to dominate the fleets of the CIS with the Imperator being extremely well rounded while the Tector lost a lot of that versatility in order to be better against the large numbers of cruisers and frigates fielded by the Republic’s Enemies. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ABB,The Invincible was a relic of a warship by the time of the Clone Wars but still remained in service due to successive waves of modernisations on the design. By the time of the war it was largely dependent on its deep reserves of concussion missiles to deal with enemies alongside a large array of anti fighter weapons. Victory Star Destroyers escorted by Gladiator Star Destroyers could add their own considerable barrage of missiles to further overwhelm any defences of the enemy and thus ensuring enough missiles arrive on target with destructive results.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ABC,The Republic made heavy use of carrier warships during the Clone Wars as a direct counter to the droid swarm fighters of the CIS. As the war progressed this eventually resulted in the Republic being able to gain local fighter superiority wherever they focused their industrial and military might. Led by the rare Secutor Star Destroyer, large numbers of Venators and Acclamators could deploy an overwhelming swarm of high quality fighters to gain control of any battle space, followed up by waves of bombers and long range turbolaser fire to eradicate any large vessel in the area. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ABD,Republic naval doctrine underwent a shift over the course of The Clone Wars, the navy began to move away from a reliance on carriers in favour of more direct firepower. The Praetor-I was still unmatched in its class, and the improved Victory II Star Destroyer proved valuable in stripping enemy shields. The new Imperator Star Destroyer was grouped with them to bridge the gap and provide some fighter support.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ABE,The Republic needed significant firepower and significant fight and bomber reserves in order to overcome the most defensible Confederate worlds and their defence forces. The Praetor-I Battlecruiser was an obvious choice, and in order to provide self-sufficient carrier support, the Secutor class was assigned to accompany the Praetor into hostile space.

TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_CIS_DESIGN_TRADE_OFFS,A sad reality is that many of our ship designs were meant for private security operations for corporations. Now they are being used for conventional warfare some issues have been found in their designs and we are not able to fix all of them. Given our production capabilities it might be more effective to sacrifice the survivability of our ships to increase their firepower and speed. This allows for better swarming of the Republic forces.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_CIS_SECRET_HYPERSPACE_ROUTE,Not all who support our cause do so openly but some remain embedded in the society and government systems of the Republic. One of these anonymous benefactors is willing to divulge to us a seemingly forgotten hyperspace route in return for a generous donation. This route would allow us to bring in unexpected reinforcements from an unengaged taskforce. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_HUTT_CARTELS_BOOTANA_HUTTA_REINFORCEMENT,In the ancient past the Hutts used to be the overlords of an expansionist Empire but the devastation of many wars such as the Xim Wars and the later Hutt Cataclysm caused the Hutts to change their philosophy away from wars of conquests with slave armies towards soft power and subversion of others. While the contemporary Hutts outwardly seem relatively peaceful and passive, the Hutts still maintain a secret military on the Core Worlds with the Bootana Hutta Fleet being a strong mobile force ready to crush any unwanted attention aimed at their Core Worlds. If the Hutts ever decide to “wake up” and return to the aggression of old, this fleet could also form the core of a revitalised Hutt Navy.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_HUTT_CARTELS_PROFIT_MOTIVE,The Hutts are always mindful to find ways to defend or even increase their power and the Hutts have developed a preference to leveraging their economic strength instead of more mindless destructive displays of strength. Overseers squeeze out every inch of profit possible from the economic endeavours under their control while Commanders are careful with the deployment of military forces in order to conserve their strength over the long run to avoid the anger of their Hutt lords at any undue losses and the costs thus incurred in their replacement.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ACE_CLONING_PROGRAM,While Jango Fett is the best known clone template, the Republic cloned many other skilled people to meet the needs of its army in the hope that the clones would inherit the abilities and talents of their templates. Secure the allocation of elite clone pilot templates to help clear the area of droids.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_PDF_FLEETS,Before the cowardly and treasonous surprise attack of the CIS, the Republic had no need of its own navy or army. Instead planets were responsible for their own defences. If needed we can draw on these planetary defence fleets of loyal Republic worlds to bolster our forces although it will mean diverting funds temporarily to their local government. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_SECRET_FLEETS,During the course of the war, the Supreme Chancellor channelled money into several black projects. One of those projects was the construction of multiple secret fleets to be deployed at the final moments of the war to secure a victory. While it will temporarily hurt our economy, the surprise arrival of a battle fleet would surely help us gain a rapid victory before the enemy can recover.

TEXT_UPGRADE_TOOLTIP_SPACE_ASTEROID_MINE_INCREASED_HEALTH_FLUFF,Given our reliance on local resource extraction to fund our efforts in this theatre alongside the exposed nature of the local resource deposits to any enemy raids; it is highly advised to invest into efforts to increase the durability of our mining outposts. These will still not enable the facilities to withstand any determined assault but should assist them in surviving minor attacks long enough for allied forces to react and crush the raid.

TEXT_UPGRADE_TOOLTIP_SPACE_SECONDARY_INCREASED_HEALTH_FLUFF,Throughout the campaign in the local sector, commanders might find it necessary to construct or restore additional stations or turrets to provide security for key areas of the battlefield. Improving production quality of the shield generators and the armour plates of these structures would improve their ability to lockdown an area.

TEXT_UPGRADE_TOOLTIP_SPACE_STARBASE_INCREASED_DEFENCE_FLUFF,The central space station serves as our command and control centre for this entire theatre of battle in addition to being the main communication facility which enables us to request further reinforcements. Alongside it the Research Station is what allows us to bolster many aspects of our military forces and local economy. The loss of either space station would be catastrophic to our war efforts and thus measures should be taken to increase its resilience to enemy attacks, be it increasing the armour plates of the station or the durability of their protective shields.
TEXT_UPGRADE_TOOLTIP_SPACE_STARBASE_INCREASED_DEFENCES_L1,Increase the defence of the main and research starbases from 0% to 10%

TEXT_UPGRADE_TOOLTIP_SPACE_STARBASE_INCREASED_SHIELD_FLUFF,Due to the vital importance of the two main space stations under our control, it is advisable to seek out methods to increase the endurance of their shield generators. The longer the station’s shield can withstand the barrage of enemy fire the longer the station’s weapon systems can remain fully operational and the more time allied forces have to react. This gives the stations the best chance to survive hostile actions.
