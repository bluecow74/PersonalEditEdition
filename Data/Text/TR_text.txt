MB_FOTG_SPACE_CORUSCANT_EVACUATION,Coruscant is under attack by a massive Imperial fleet striking from the Deep Core. Many of the ships in this fleet were believed by New Republic Intelligence to have been destroyed years ago. Garm Bel Iblis and his hopelessly outnumbered defenders make a fighting retreat as the government evacuates...
MB_FOTG_SPACE_KATANA_BATTLE,The Katana Fleet was a task force of two hundred specially modified Dreadnaught Heavy Cruisers. The Galactic Republic commissioned this fleet just after the Stark Hyperspace War in an attempt to bolster the Republic Navy's ability to respond to pirate threats. To reduce crew requirements, the Katana Dreadnaughts were equipped with state-of-the-art automation technology, and the 199 ordinary ships of the fleet were slave-rigged to the flagship's computer systems. Unfortunately, the entire fleet was lost on its maiden voyage; a hive virus drove the crewmen insane and the admiral used the flagship's master controls to send the entire fleet on a blind hyperspace jump. They were not heard from again – until now...
MB_LAND_PLANET_BYSS_02,A team of New Republic commandos led by Lando Calrissian and Wedge Antilles has secretly stowed away in a shipment of Balmorran X-1 Viper war droids bound for Byss. Once they arrive, they will launch a sneak attack using the hijacked war machines. Their objective is as simple as it is audacious: destroy the Emperor's Cloning Facility and end his evil reign once and for all!

TEXT_CONQUEST_BFC_DL_INTRO_ONE,Nil Spaar: I am Nil Spaar, and I am the Viceroy of the Duskhan League. It is time for us to achieve our destiny and wipe the filth from the galaxy. The New Republic will die. Beginning today, their lives depend on their being useful to us. The Yevetha are not civilized, Commander. It would be a mistake to deal with us as though we were.
TEXT_CONQUEST_BFC_NR_INTRO_ONE,Leia Organa Solo: Our peace talks with the Duskhan League have fallen through; it's time for military action. I don't think there's any question but that Nil Spaar represents more worlds, a larger population, greater material riches, and a more advanced industrial-technological base than anyone who's come to Imperial City in the last twelve years. And he probably knows it, too.
TEXT_CONQUEST_BFC_SORANNONS_REVOLT,Sil Sorannan: This is Major Sil Sorannan of the Black Sword Command, Imperial Navy--acting captain of the Super Star Destroyer Intimidator and commodore of the Camp Pa'aal Squadron. For twelve years of torture, and too many friends, there isn't enough I can do to you, viceroy, I already know that killing you won't be satisfying. This is good-bye. We are taking back what is ours, starting with our freedom and these ships. We leave the New Republic to you.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_DOCUMENT_FOUND_IR,Gilad Pellaeon: Intel combed the data tapes we recovered from the Hand of Thrawn and found an original copy of the Caamas Document. I can use this to begin treaty negotiations with the New Republic.\n[ PEACE TREATY VICTORY AVAILABLE ]
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_DOCUMENT_FOUND_NR,Luke Skywalker: We found an unaltered copy of the Caamas Document on Nirauan! This should put an end to the crisis on Bothawui and in the Senate. Now we have a chance to begin peace talks with Pellaeon.\n[ PEACE TREATY VICTORY AVAILABLE ]
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_HAND_INTRO,Voss Parck: When Grand Admiral Thrawn left us, he instructed us to wait ten years for his return. That day has not yet come, but the New Republic's present crisis has given us a chance that won't come again. We must act now, or the Empire won't live to see Thrawn's return. Just as the Grand Admiral foresaw, it falls to us to lend a steadying hand to this ailing galaxy - with or without him.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_HINT_THRAWN_1_ALL,At the end of Cycle 10, two Thrawns have the potential to appear:
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_HINT_THRAWN_2_ALL,- If the Empire of the Hand has not lost the Hand of Thrawn on Nirauan, a clone of Grand Admiral Thrawn will take over the Hand. 
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_HINT_THRAWN_3_ALL,- If Vilim Disra and Grodin Tierce are alive, an imposter Thrawn will take over the Empire.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_HINT_THRAWN_4_E_H,If only one Thrawn appears, a few heroes and ships from the other faction will defect to Thrawn's side.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_HINT_THRAWN_4_NR,If only one Thrawn appears, the Empire and the Hand will join forces under Thrawn.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_HINT_THRAWN_5_E_H,If the imposter appears, Gilad Pellaeon will defect to the Hand.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_IR_INTRO,Gilad Pellaeon: The Moff Council's vanity has brought the Empire to its lowest point yet, but there's still hope. The New Republic's present crisis may be our chance to end this war. If we can provide the New Republic with an original copy of the Caamas Document, that may earn us enough goodwill to begin peace negotiations.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_NR_INTRO,Ponc Gavrisom: The New Republic is on the verge of civil war. A document was found that implicates prominent Bothans in the bombing of Caamas. Many Senators have demanded they stand trial, but Bothawui refuses to cooperate. Many Republic systems have called up their local forces, and are threatening to send them to Bothawui to force the issue.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_PEACE_GAVRISOM,Ponc Gavrisom: Though the Empire committed grave injustices in the past, these cannot be righted with more injustice. Those who wished for liberation are liberated. Now is the time to bury old grievances.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_PEACE_PELLAEON,Gilad Pellaeon: Despite all the blood that has been shed, I still believe that the ideals of the New Order have value. We disagree on many things, but from now on, our war will be one of ideas. The Galactic Civil War is over.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_PELLAEON_KILLED_IR,Imperial Navy Captain: Without Admiral Pellaeon to hold them back, the Moff Council would sooner throw all our lives away than accept peace with the New Republic. They will continue this war until no one is left to take a blaster bolt for them.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_PELLAEON_KILLED_NR,Gavrisom: Admiral Pellaeon has been killed in battle. Without him, the peace faction in the Imperial Navy no longer has a voice in the Moff Council. All hope for ending this war without further bloodshed is lost. Do what you must, Commander.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_RETURN_GAVRISOM_ONE,Ponc Gavrisom: If Palpatine could return, perhaps Thrawn can do the same... Making matters worse, intel reports that outsiders from the Unknown Regions have joined with the Empire. The Senate is still in turmoil, so no reinforcements are coming. The survival of the Republic hinges on your forces, Commander.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_RETURN_GAVRISOM_TWO,Ponc Gavrisom: We have received two different versions of this message - one broadcast from Bastion, the other from the Unknown Regions. It's hard enough to believe Thrawn could return after so long, but two Thrawns..? Whatever the Imperials and these outsiders are scheming, you must put a stop to it.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_RETURN_PARCK_DOUBT,Voss Parck: He looks very convincing, but our spies have given me reason to believe that this so-called Thrawn is an imposter. I wish the Grand Admiral were back as much as they do, but this charade is really quite disrespectful to his memory. Let's put an end to it.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_RETURN_PARCK_FOLLOW,Voss Parck: Just as you promised, you have returned to us! We stand ready to restore peace and order to the galaxy at your command, Grand Admiral.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_RETURN_PELLAEON_DEFECT,Gilad Pellaeon: Disra may think he has the upper hand, but I haven't spent my life in service to the Empire just to let a greedy fool like him destroy everything the New Order stands for. Helm, set course for the Unknown Regions!
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_RETURN_PELLAEON_DOUBT,Gilad Pellaeon: I watched Thrawn die on the bridge of the Chimaera. I scrubbed his life's blood from the tread of my boots. I don't know whose sick game this is, but I refuse to play.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_THRAWN_RETURNS,Thrawn: This is Grand Admiral Thrawn. I have returned to restore Imperial rule to the galaxy. I call on all loyal subjects of the Empire, in the known galaxy and beyond, to follow me. To the leaders of the Rebellion: I urge you to surrender now and spare the galaxy further bloodshed.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CAAMAS_VICTORY_TREATY,- [ALTERNATIVE OBJECTIVE] Control Nirauan with Pellaeon alive and zero Thrawns active (Early victory can be triggered from Political Options Menu).
TEXT_CONQUEST_CARNOR_NR_INTRO_LEIA,Leia: The Emperor is dead, and the Imperials are fighting amongst themselves again, but we have a lot of work to do if we're going to recover from the last few years. It's like Endor all over again.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CARNOR_PA_INTRO_ONE,Moff: Although Kaine is dead, the Pentastar Alignment lives on. Our losses in the last few years are proof our initial position of striking out on our own was correct. The Rebels are occupied with reclaiming the Core; I suggest you work to secure our borders while we can.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CSA_CSA_INTRO_E1,Viceprex Vaz-Weplinn: We can no longer rely on the old agreements. Fragments of the Empire fight over our territory, hoping to steal our resources and profits, while all too many voices in the New Republic condemn our business practices. In order to preserve the Authority, the Board has authorized full mobilization of our forces. Our independence rests on your shoulders, Commander. Halt any move against it by whatever means necessary.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CSA_CSA_INTRO_E2,Viceprex Vaz-Weplinn: Zsinj's illegal seizure of our resources ends now! The time to rely on agreements made with the Old Republic has ended. From now on, we will enforce our independence with fleets rather than bureaucrats.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CSA_CSA_INTRO_E3,Viceprex Vaz-Weplinn: The Emperor may be back, but that doesn't mean a return to Imperial control. With less and less oversight and taxes, profits have soared, and the Direx Board is determined to keep things that way.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CSA_CSA_INTRO_E4,Viceprex Vaz-Weplinn: The New Republic has been making overtures, but the Direx Board rejects their oversight. We don't need their ideals and taxes cutting into our returns, and they won't stomach enough war to force themselves upon us. It's time to show this new government we mean business.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CSA_CSA_INTRO_E7,Angela Krin: Ah, good to see you commander. It's getting to be a real mess here. The plague on Endregaad is raging almost unchecked, and neither the Hutts nor the New Republic are very happy about how we're handling it. I also have reason to think this new Tempest spice may have originated from the Hutts. I don't look forward to confronting them about it, but that spice is dangerous and we need to shut down the flow.
TEXT_CONQUEST_DELTA_SOURCE_INTRO,Thrawn: Delta Source, Commander, reporting all manner of valuable information right from the heart of the Rebels' fragile government. You don't have clearance to know the precise nature of our informant, but rest assured I will pass along any useful knowledge that comes through the encrypted channels.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EMPIRE_CSA_INTRO_E1,Grand Admiral Makati: Greetings, commander. It's good to see High Command finally sending those reinforcements. The Rebel presence grows stronger every day, the Corporate Sector is getting restless, and Zsinj is proving less trustworthy than I'd hoped. It's past time some order was restored to this corner of the galaxy.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EMPIRE_CSA_INTRO_E1_HINT,Conquer Korriban to gain Kadann (Spy) and Jedgar (Sith) as heroes!
TEXT_CONQUEST_EMPIRE_CSA_INTRO_E2,Llon Banjeer: Zsinj had a good run, but he's dead and it's time to get back into the good graces of the Ruling Council. Gather any likeminded followers and let's see how much we can reclaim before Rogriss shows up.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EMPIRE_CSA_INTRO_E3,Emperor Palpatine: Root out these pathetic Rebels wherever they may be! The troublesome Alliance has fled to Mon Calamari and these Corporate fools think to defy me, but none can stand against the might of my Empire!
TEXT_CONQUEST_EMPIRE_CSA_PROPHETS,Grand Admiral Makati: Well, well, well. The exiled prophets, returned to the Imperial fold. If we weren't so short on personnel I'd take great pleasure in executing them, but they may prove useful to the campaign. Keep a close watch on them commander, and don't trouble yourself too much if they die for the glory of the Empire.

TEXT_CONQUEST_ENDOR_NR_STORY_WARLORDS_SPLIT,Some of the Imperials seem to be firing on each other? Their entire fleet has fractured. Keep up the offensive!
TEXT_CONQUEST_EOTH_INTRO_E1,Thrawn: Greetings, Commander. I am Grand Admiral Thrawn, and I welcome you to the Empire of the Hand; a confederation of my own making that will act as a bulwark for the threats to come. Word has reached me of the Emperor's death over Endor. While unfortunately this will cut us off from supplies from the Empire, it is ultimately irrelevant. I may have to return to it in time if the remaining leadership proves inept, but until then we must secure our position in the Unknown Regions.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EOTH_INTRO_E2,Thrawn: The Empire of the Hand welcomes you. Recent reports from Imperial Center bring troubling news; Director Isard has taken over and the entire Empire is in chaos as a result. While I have no wish to leave the foundation I've laid here behind, I may have to when her regime inevitably collapses simply to save what's left of the Empire. Consider this a warning ahead of time Commander, and be prepared for what's to come.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EOTH_INTRO_E3,Voss Parck: I am Admiral Parck. Thrawn has asked me to debrief you on recent events. With the death of Director Isard, Thrawn has returned to the known galaxy to take control of the Empire. Unfortunately, this puts us at odd with him; however, Thrawn has instructed us that, even if he must be struck down, he will return in time. I have a sneaking suspicion of what he has in mind for the future, but until that point we must not disappoint him.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EOTH_INTRO_E4,Voss Parck: We have, unfortunately, received reports of the death of Grand Admiral Thrawn. However, he informed me before his departure that in case of such news, to await his return one decade later. In the meantime, we must continue our work. Be advised, our sources that remain in the Empire informed me of a large scale Imperial offensive originating from the Deep Core, headed by a figure known as the 'Omnipotent Battle Leader.' I would be surprised if the Empire could sustain an offensive after Thrawn's death, but be cautious all the same.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EOTH_INTRO_E5,Voss Parck: The Emperor has died once again; despite my former oath to the man, I can't help but think the dead should've stayed dead. Nonetheless, the work of the Empire of the Hand must continue. With the Empire in disarray and the Rebels unable to recover themselves, perhaps it is time we reconsider our isolationist stance. I leave the ultimate decision up to you.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EOTH_INTRO_E6,Voss Parck: The Empire is, once again, rudderless and without proper direction. The New Republic has proven more tenacious than I could have imagined. I suggest we redouble our effort; if the galaxy continues to stay divided, we must unite it by force.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EOTH_INTRO_E7,Voss Parck: It is finally time to make our leave from the Unknown Regions, Commander. Thrawn told us to watch for his return a decade after his departure, and that time is nearly upon us. We must unite the galaxy before the threats from beyond can catch us all off guard. We must succeed, for we have no more time to waste.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_CARNOR_INTRO,Sander Delvardus: The Emperor may have yet again been defeated, but construction of the Night Hammer is complete. We must establish ourselves as the dominant Imperial force in the Core.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_DEEPCORE_INTRO,Sander Delvardus: New arrivals to the Core have put us in a dangerous position, but the Night Hammer is nearly complete. Soon, I shall sweep away all resistance!
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_DEEPCORE_INTRO_E2,Sander Delvardus: I may have been pushed into these minor territories with petty fleets, but my hour will come! Clear away these contentious pretenders so that my reach may extend across the galaxy once more!
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_DEEPCORE_NH,Sander Delvardus: At last! Years of labor in secret shipyards, tens of thousands of diverted credits, countless logistic sacrifices for the rest of the fleet... The Night Hammer is complete and my time has come! Forgive me, Seledra.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_INTRO_E1,Sander Delvardus: Eriadu welcomes you, Commander. The noble families, including the Tarkins, have asked us to protect their holdings around the Hydian Way, but I have grander ideas. We will strike up to the Core and retake the glory and technology of the Empire for ourselves. I trust you are up to the task.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_INTRO_E2,Sander Delvardus: Betrayal! The Eriadu nobles have turned their backs on my superior vision, claiming we are not protecting their interests. Our forces along the galactic south remain strong however, so victory against the encroaching Rebels and traitors shall be easy to accomplish, I assure you. 
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_INTRO_E3,Sander Delvardus: We have been pushed to the Deep Core and lost some support from the cowards in the Imperial Army. But my will remains unbroken, and now power and opportunity presents itself to us! My sources in the ISB say some alien cretin now leads the Imperial fleet. The distraction it provides presents us the chance to rebound to glory.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_INTRO_E4,Sander Delvardus: My time is now! The Emperor, or a very good impersonator, now leads a new Imperial offensive from the Deep Core and beyond. While I have received a... tempting offer from this so-called 'Omnipotent Battle Leader,' we must capitalize on their offensive first. The vulnerable world of Metellos should be an excellent early target.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_INTRO_E5,Sander Delvardus: The Emperor is dead once again, and I have gained nothing for my triumphs working for that walking corpse! This only proves that I was right to strike out on my own. Now that the Empire is in shambles yet again, we must deal with the nearby warlords and use our superior military might to finish the New Republic once and for all! 
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_INTRO_E6,Sander Delvardus: My final triumph is nigh! Despite the constant setbacks, I am sure ultimate victory against those within the Deep Core and beyond are just ahead of us. Rally our forces and lead the assault commander; I will not, and cannot fail so close to achieving my goals.

TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_EMPIRE_REBORN,Desann: I have seen the strength of the Jedi, and I have found it lacking. Yours is an Empire that knows the Force is not a shield to protect the useless, but a weapon to empower the worthy. The Empire Reborn is at your command.

TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_CCOGM_ERA,Bertroff Hissa: To my fellow Grand Moffs, Grand Admirals, and the others, I bid you all Dark Greetings! We have gathered here today to mark a new beginning. Let us all swear loyalty to the Trueborn son of Palpatine- Emperor Trioculus! 
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_DAALA_CONTACT,Natasi Daala: This is Admiral Natasi Daala, of the Maw Research Facility. I have been isolated from the wider galaxy for many years, and only now see what has become of the Empire. The in-fighting and petty bickering has lessened all Imperials, and it is time for it to stop. I have no intention of becoming a political leader, but if no one else shall step up, I will gladly give my all to restore order to the galaxy.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_DAALA_ERA,Natasi Daala: The destruction of Imperial fleets by other Imperials must come to an end. Once we stop the ridiculous infighting these warlords have perpetuated, the Empire will retake its rightful place in the galaxy.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_JAX_CONTACT,Carnor Jax: I come to you with an offer commander. I am Carnor Jax, one of Palpatine's Royal Guard; yet I hold grander ambitions for the throne itself. To accomplish this I plan to poison his clones, ensuring his permanent death. With your assistance this can be guaranteed, and the Empire will be mine to command. I plan to justly reward all supporters of my reign, and eliminate all who oppose me in equal measure. The choice is yours.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_JAX_EMPIRE_DEFEATED,Carnor Jax: Even the ashes of Palpatine's Empire have blown away. There is nothing left for me here. I will seek my own fortune.\n[ No more regimes will appear. The Maw is unlocked. ]
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_JAX_ERA,Carnor Jax: The Emperor is dead; let him rot in the past where he belongs. Now it is time to look to the future. A new Empire shall be forged from the remains of the old, and I will sit on its throne. With the power of the Force at my hands, I will soon surpass even Vader and Palpatine. Ready yourself Commander. The galaxy has changed—it's mine for the taking!
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_PALPATINE_CONTACT,Palpatine: The traitors thought me gone, but death is simply one of many obstacles I have conquered. Now I am ready to lead the Empire once more, with secret weapons of untold power at my command. Submit yourselves to my inevitable return and you shall be rewarded beyond your imagination. Only then, shall we be able to achieve our ultimate victory over the Rebellion.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_PALPATINE_CONTACT_ENEMY,Palpatine: By the unlimited power of the Dark Side, I have returned from death to rule this galaxy once more - now and forever! Those who remained true to me shall be rewarded. To the rest of you, I offer only the choice to die now, or later. It is inevitable. [Palpatine has formed Dark Empire in another faction]
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_PALPATINE_ERA,Palpatine: I have returned, stronger than ever, through my undisputed mastery of the Dark Side! The pretenders who thought to usurp my rule have failed, and the Rebellion in its weakness has failed to destroy my Empire. The traitors will pay dearly for this mistake, for now I am prepared to reap a great and awful terror upon the peons who thought the petty trappings of mortality could stop me! Mobilize the fleets; the time of the Empire's ultimate victory has come.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_PELLAEON_CONTACT,Daala: I believe the right person to lead the Empire forward is Gilad Pellaeon, though he may never admit it himself. With the Empire in Pellaeon's capable hands, I will continue my work in the Deep Core to bring the remaining warlords into line.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_PELLAEON_EMPIRE_DEFEATED,Gilad Pellaeon: I've fought to protect the ideals of the New Order for half my life, but I see now that they have truly passed away. I think it's time I retired.\n[ No more regimes will appear. ]
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_PELLAEON_ERA,Gilad Pellaeon: I never desired to rule, but if the Empire has called on me I will step forward. Much has changed in the galaxy, and we must acknowledge that. If we do not adapt, it is over for the Empire and all we have fought for. It's time the Empire works its way towards our new future.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_THRAWN_CONTACT,Thrawn: This is Grand Admiral Thrawn. I am currently preparing to conclude my work in the Unknown Regions and return to the Empire, which I seem to notice has some need of my assistance since Endor. No doubt this will mean the current leadership will desert. If you should prefer my earlier return, I am prepared to assume command of the Imperial fleet as necessary.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_THRAWN_DEATH,Navy Officer: The tragic death of Grand Admiral Thrawn will not go unavenged. Our objective is still the same: the total victory of the Empire. All remaining Imperial forces must stand together regardless of leadership to wipe out the threat of rebellion!
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_THRAWN_ERA,Thrawn: I have returned from the Unknown Regions, and I am disappointed at the unruly state of the galaxy. The Ruling Council has granted me its blessing, and what is left of the fleet has been placed under my control. Now it is time to solve the only puzzle worth solving-the complete, total and utter destruction of the Rebellion.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_YSANNE_ERA,Ysanne Isard: This is Director Isard. All Imperial forces are now under my control. My wish is the death of this Rebellion. Now with the Empire in my hands, there will be no one to stop me from making that wish come true.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_ZSINJ_ESCAPES,Grand Moff Zsinj: Until the upgrades on my Executor 'Iron Fist' are completed, I will oversee our expansion efforts from the bridge of Rancor Base. Until then, good hunt, commander.
TEXT_CONQUEST_FIP_IR_DAALA_DEATH,Gilad Pellaeon: Admiral Daala knew what she was getting into when she agreed to this campaign, but her loss pains me nonetheless. The Empire has lost much to the Moff Council's arrogance. But it is up to us to save what is left of it, Commander, or her sacrifice will be for nothing.
TEXT_CONQUEST_FIP_IR_INTRO,Gilad Pellaeon: The Moff Council has informed me that unless I attack immediately, they will relieve me of command. The Empire can't survive another civil war, so I have no choice but to comply. If we can manage enough successive victories around the Core we might be able to force the New Republic to a favorable peace. I've contacted Admiral Daala in the Deep Core and she's ready to support our attack.
TEXT_CONQUEST_FIP_IR_MEGADOR,Gilad Pellaeon: Dominion and Rakehell are battle-ready, but maintenance shortfalls have forced me to mothball Megador. If we secure the Bilbringi shipyards and their supply depots we can relaunch Megador. Until then, I'll be commanding from Chimaera.
TEXT_CONQUEST_FIP_IR_ROGRISS_DEATH,Gilad Pellaeon: So die traitors. Goodbye, Teren.
TEXT_CONQUEST_FIP_NR_DAALA_DEATH,Gial Ackbar: Intelligence reports that Scylla's wreckage wasn't found after the battle. Perhaps Daala has cheated death once more. If she comes back, we will defeat her again; as many times as it takes.
TEXT_CONQUEST_FIP_NR_GUARDIAN,Gial Ackbar: I've ordered General Antilles and Lusankya to stay back and guard the Trans-Hydian. As for myself, Guardian is still in need of repairs at the Bilbringi shipyards. Once she's combat-ready, I will take command personally.
TEXT_CONQUEST_FIP_NR_INTRO,Gial Ackbar: We're under attack on two fronts, Commander. Pellaeon has launched an attack on the Orinda front while Daala strikes from the Deep Core. This unprovoked attack has proved to the Senate that the Empire isn't ready for peace. We've been ordered to repel this invasion and then make a counteroffensive. If this was Pellaeon's idea, he has surely gone mad.

TEXT_CONQUEST_HAN_RESPAWN,Han Solo: Well that feels like a sign. I'm done with big ships now. If you need me, I'll be on the Falcon with Chewie from here on out.

TEXT_CONQUEST_HARRSK_DEEPCORE_E3,Blitzer Harrsk: The ingrates on Imperial Center have proven too incompetent for me to stand any longer, so I've established my own faction, Zero Command! Already I have gained the support of Grand Admiral Batch's former crew, along with the ships I've acquired from Endor, and with you and Captain Thoath's support, victory is assured! But before I can claim the rest of the Empire, we need to deal with Teradoc and Delvardus, who are intruding on my domain.
TEXT_CONQUEST_HARRSK_DEEPCORE_E4,Bolla Thoath: Welcome to the Deep Core Commander, such as it is. I could pretend you should be honored to serve the glory of the Supreme Warlord and his fleet, but let's not make fools of ourselves. Admiral Harrsk is growing more erratic lately, as this prolonged and indecisive sparring with the other warlords is worsening his decision-making skills. I'd like to ask you to take command of our forces, as I can only save the admiral from himself for so much longer.
TEXT_CONQUEST_HARRSK_DEEPCORE_E6,Blitzer Harrsk: Countless ships, wasted at the hands of that ghoul Palpatine. And what to show for it? Nothing! It is clear we must focus only on our Deep Core rivals if I am truly to succeed, despite Captain Thoath's protests. The time for games is over. I want Delvardus and Teradoc's heads on pikes next to my throne, and if I have to burn through every remaining ship in our fleet to do it, then so be it. Get to work commander, before I reconsider where your own head should belong.
TEXT_CONQUEST_HARRSK_DEEPCORE_NH,Blitzer Harrsk: Blast! Delvardus has constructed a Super Star Destroyer. Where did he get the men to crew it...
TEXT_CONQUEST_HISSA_IR_INTRO_ONE,Bertroff Hissa: To you Commander, my fellow Grand Moffs, to the Grand Admirals, and all others, I bid you all Dark Greetings! We have gathered here today to mark a new beginning. The Rebels have yet to see the full fury of our power and our might. We are developing even more advanced weapons, and when we are done, we shall rule the entire galaxy and crush the Rebel Alliance. Let us now swear undying fealty to the Trueborn son of Palpatine, Emperor Trioculus!
TEXT_CONQUEST_HUTTS_CSA_INTRO_E7,Parella: [Interesting times, commander. Popara's son Mika is trapped on a world quarantined by the Corporate Sector, and his attempts at rescue grow ever bolder. Hopefully he doesn't provoke them too far... I have also heard rumors of a most curious spice appearing from sources unknown, potent and lucrative. We mustn't let some interloper grow too strong. It's time to reassert the children of Varl's control of the markets.]
TEXT_CONQUEST_HUTTS_CSA_MIKA,Mika Anjiliac Chiera: [Perhaps now you realize the splendor of my conception. With each shipment of the tempest spice, my shadow empire grows in power. Soon, I will control every starport and slum from the Tion Cluster to the Ison Corridor.]
TEXT_CONQUEST_INTRO_ODUMIN,Odumin: Please stop shushing me, sir; I will be heard! At issue is the survival and more importantly, profit of the Corporate Sector Authority. If you mind the books we'll all be better for it.
TEXT_CONQUEST_INTRO_ODUMIN_E3,Odumin: With Zsinj's death, the Corporate Sector Authority can continue our business unimpeded. Just looking at the mess of sheets and balances they left make me wish we killed him. If you can mind the books, I'm sure we can recover from this and continue making a profit.
TEXT_CONQUEST_INTRO_TAA_ONE,Ta'a Chume: It's a dangerous time for even the Consortium- I trust you will find yourself up to the task of leading our forces. Hapes can only be as strong as those who lead her, and it would be a shame to have to replace one such as yourself.
TEXT_CONQUEST_INTRO_TENENIEL_ONE,Teneniel Djo: Greetings, friend. It is my honour as Queen Mother to greet a traveler from the stars such as yourself to Hapes. The task of protecting the Consortium will be a difficult one, but together we may face down any foe.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_DEATH,Wedge Antilles: Isard's been defeated, and the people of the galaxy can rest a little easier now. But that's not all; her ship Lusankya is in our hands now. I have no love lost if we just scrap it considering all the horrors that thing has hosted, but a Star Dreadnaught of that power after the proper repairs could make a huge difference for the New Republic.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_IR_INTRO_BACTA,Isard: Our scientists have developed a virus which we have deployed on Coruscant to sow disorder and hostility among the Rebels. We need to take advantage of the situation and strike as soon as possible.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_IR_INTRO_ONE,Ysanne Isard: I am Director Isard, future Empress of a supreme Empire. The Rebels are continually harassing our borders, and the other pretenders to the Imperial throne have become greedy. They have truly bitten off more than they can chew and they will be choked to death because of it. The Empire will rise again and the natural order of things will again be established. I hope I am not mistaken in trusting you to maintain a certain level of competence.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_IR_INTRO_PSA,Ysanne Isard: Imperial Intelligence believes this area of the galaxy has a strong Rebel presence, and agents of Ardus Kaine have recently become more active. We cannot allow Kaine to secede from the Empire. I am occupied elsewhere but I am sure you are up to the challenge, commander. Make an example of him for those who would challenge our authority.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_BACTA_FIVE,The Vratix have successfully eradicated the Rylca! We can finally end the epidemic and focus on military efforts against the Empire.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_BACTA_FOUR,Good work, commander. Mirax has safely made it to Borleias with the Ryll Kor. Now all we need to do is produce the Rylca. We need to be quick, a lot of non-humans are beginning to think this is some sort of conspiracy, and Councillor Fey'lya's comments aren't helping.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_BACTA_ONE,This is Wedge Antilles of Rogue Squadron. We've managed to secure Coruscant, commander, but the Empire appears to have unleashed some kind of virus targeting non-humans. We're trying to quarantine the problem but it's getting out of hand. General Cracken is getting the Vratix established on Borleias to look into a cure.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_BACTA_THREE,We've successfully secured the Ryll Kor with the cooperation of the Twi'leks. Send Mirax Terrik from Ryloth to Borleias so the Vratix can finish developing the treatment. Her father, Booster, can provide an escort with the Star Destroyer he captured, and the Twi'lek Tal'dira has joined us as well.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_BACTA_TWO,The Vratix have completed their research. They think they've discovered a cure, but we need some more supplies. You'll need to go to Ryloth and extract some Ryll Kor to bring back to the Vratix on Borleias.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_INTRO_MOTHMA,Mon Mothma: Our gradual advance against the splintered Imperials is bearing fruit. But now Director Ysanne Isard has taken command of the Empire, and the other warlords remain an ever present threat. Be careful in your advance, Commander, and may the Force be with you.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_INTRO_ONE,Mon Mothma: Hello, Commander. The New Republic is swiftly getting stronger; however our position is not entirely secured yet. Director Isard has taken command of the Empire, and Warlord Zsinj and Moff Kaine remain in powerful positions in the galaxy. Be careful in your planning and we may yet achieve peace.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_INTRO_TSA,Mon Mothma: Ardus Kaine and the Pentastar Alignment have so far been peaceful towards us, but we still ought to be careful. Director Isard and her forces appear to be active in the area as well. We must neutralize these threats or I fear peace may never return.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_YONKA_DEFECTS,Wedge Antilles: Excellent work! Yonka has not only left Isard, but joined us with nearly the full crew of the Avarice!
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_YONKA_DESERTS,Ysanne Isard: That worthless captain Sair Yonka has betrayed us! It seems he no longer has the stomach to what must be done to keep order, and may have even gone over to the Rebel scum! If we ever come across him or his family, he must pay for this treachery!
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_YONKA_INTRO,Wedge Antilles: Our intelligence reports indicate that one of Isard's captains, Sair Yonka of the Star Destroyer Avarice, is growing disillusioned with her bloody policies. He makes regular visits to the Outer Rim near Ryloth, so we may have an opportunity to meet with him and convince him to desert her.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARDSREVENGE_IR_INTRO_ONE,Delak Krennel: The New Republic may mean to make an example of the Ciutric Hegemony, but with Isard's help, we'll show them they're nothing next to the Empire's might.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARDSREVENGE_IR_LUSANKYA,Ysanne Isard: No! Word has just reached me that the Rebels have deployed a new vessel: my old flagship the Lusankya. They told the galaxy it had been scrapped, but now I must face down my own command.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARDSREVENGE_IR_ROGUES,Ysanne Isard: It seems we lost an entire fighter wing in the battle, but Rogue Squadron has been eliminated by my trap! A patrol nearly caught the Errant Venture snooping around the wreckage, but there can be little doubt: Wedge Antilles will no longer be a thorn in my side.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARDSREVENGE_NR_INTRO_ONE,Mon Mothma: Thrawn's attacks hit us hard, commander. Before the remaining Imperials get any ideas, we need to show our strength. We've assembled an elite task force at Brentaal to liberate the Ciutric Hegemony from Delak Krennel's clutches.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARDSREVENGE_NR_LUSANKYA,Mon Mothma: The unseen party watching the conflict is none other than Ysanne Isard. While we were engaged with Krennel, she has raided Bilbringi and taken Lusankya from the docks. Once again, we must contend with that madwoman at the helm of a Super Star Destroyer.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARDSREVENGE_NR_REQUIEM,Mon Mothma: Rogue Squadron proves difficult to kill. It seems that most of them were saved by some other group, but General Antilles has not seen fit to say who they were. Judging by the TIE Defenders they now fly, it was some Imperial group. We must be cautious going forward.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARDSREVENGE_NR_ROGUES,Mon Mothma: Tragedy strikes us, commander. Rogue Squadron was flying cover for a reconnaissance mission in Corvis Minor when they were ambushed. The only survivor was Wes Janson, currently in critical condition. We knew this campaign would cost us lives, but today we have lost heroes.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KALBACK_RETIRE,Kalback: Our recent victories are enough for these old bones. The Empire is left reeling and it's time for me to enjoy the peace I've won while I still can. Good luck, friends, and carry on the good fight.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_BOARDING_START,Boarding started...
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_BOARDING_SUCCESS,Boarding successful, Katana Dreadnaught captured
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_REINFORCEMENTS,Blast! Enemy Reinforcements have jumped in behind us!
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_START_CHISS,Ar'alani: Nicely done, commander. Let the record show that these unwanted guests are trespassing on our shuttles' recovery operation. Dissuade them with force if need be.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_START_CORELLIA,Thrackan Sal-Solo: So much for secrecy. Still, keep those ships at bay and these shuttles might make this a trip with some worthwhile salvage.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_START_CORPORATE_SECTOR,Jona Grumby: How about that. Dark Force, just as I remember it. It looks salvageable, and we may even be able to collect some antiques for export. Bring the shuttles around to the derelicts and let's get started. Make it fast too; I don't like the look of those other ships.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_START_EMPIRE,Thrawn: So here it is, the elusive Katana Fleet. I admit I did not believe I would ever lay eyes on such a welcome sight. We must move our shuttles to capture as many dreadnaughts as possible before the Rebels are destroyed.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_START_EMPIREOFTHEHAND,Voss Parck: The Katana Fleet! Not the most modern warships, but a welcome addition to our forces nonetheless. Use the shuttles to board as many dreadnaughts as possible while our foes are dealt with.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_START_ERIADU_AUTHORITY,Delvardus: Dark Force! Not some legend after all, but the failed gem of the Old Republic fleet before our eyes. Perhaps slave rigging does have some use. Bring the shuttles close to secure as many Dreadnaughts as possible, but hurry. Scanners are showing an enemy fleet.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_START_GREATER_MALDROOD,Treuten Teradoc: What a sight! Two hundred Dreadnaughts, in near as fine a condition as the day they vanished. We have teams standing by in shuttles to reactive the ships. Bring them close while I keep the meddlers at bay.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_START_HAPES_CONSORTIUM,Isolder: So here is this 'Katana Fleet'. Crude ships, to be sure, but we may be able to learn from them as well as employ them. Send the recovery shuttles near the ships to start the work. We may not have been the only ones to find this lost fleet, but our valor will hold the day while the shuttles proceed.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_START_HUTT_CARTELS,Troonol: And so our information has proved most profitable. Old ships, but quite serviceable if we can claim them. Keep these interlopers at bay while the shuttles secure the Dark Force.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_START_KILLIK_HIVES,Saras: Memories speak truly. Let us fill this dead metal with living mind and join them to the Colony. Do not let these unjoined hinder our growth.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_START_PENTASTAR,Ardus Kaine: So the rumor was true. Dark Force itself, kept in pristine condition by hard vacuum. But we are not the only ones on this trail. Keep the shuttles safe as they bring recovery teams to the dreadnaughts.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_START_REBEL,Talon Karrde: Well, here it is, the Katana Fleet. Looks like we've got some company though; we'll have to take care of the Imperials before we can do anything with them. Try to move your transports next to the dreadnaughts and capture as many as possible.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_START_SSIRUUVI_IMPERIUM,Ivpikkis: The humans named this fleet for a blade, I am told. Keep these interlopers busy while our landing craft sharpen it for our cause.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_START_YEVETHA,Nil Spaar: New waves for the floods of Yevethan justice! Do not let these unwelcome guests hinder us, claim this prize with our ardent shuttle crews that we may turn more of these vermin's weapons against them!
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_START_ZSINJ_EMPIRE,Zsinj: What a sight! But there is no time to waste: we need to ferry crews to the dreadnaughts with our shuttles to make them operational. And it seems we have company...
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_BATTLE_TOO_LATE,We have lost the race to the Katana Fleet's resting place, and our enemies have claimed the Dark Force for themselves.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_DIALOG_DESCRIPTION,Move a fleet to Deep Space in order to recover the long-lost Katana Fleet. Your enemies have also been apprised of its location; you must act quickly if you hope to secure the Dark Force for yourself.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_DIALOG_TITLE,Dark Force Rising
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_EVENT_INTRO_CHISS,Ar'alani: The sources are highly classified, but we have heard reason to believe a lost fleet from Lesser Space may have been located. Even if it not in fighting shape, this is an unprecedented opportunity to collect materials for study. See what you can find at the rumoured site.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_EVENT_INTRO_CORELLIA,Thrackan Sal-Solo: In my business you sometimes hear things before anyone else. I have reason to suspect the Katana fleet has been found and have marked the site for you to investigate. Keep things quiet and we may be able to acquire quite a bit of firepower with no one being the wiser.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_EVENT_INTRO_CORPORATE_SECTOR,Jona Grumby: You know, I was a green young soldier when the hive virus made the Katana Fleet vanish. Hard to believe that it may have been found. But if it truly has, there could be lot of serviceable hardware to be obtained cheap if the Picket Fleet can get there first. We're authorized to send a group to the Deep Space location to investigate these whispers.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_EVENT_INTRO_EMPIRE,Thrawn: Something of interest. An old spacer of Ferrier's acquaintance has given us the location of what he believes to be the Katana Fleet. Send a fleet – led by me personally – to that location and we'll see if we can't use that fleet to our advantage.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_EVENT_INTRO_EMPIREOFTHEHAND,Voss Parck: Our spies have tracked whispers of a lost fleet that may not be so lost at all. They've placed a beacon at a location in uncharted space. We should send a task force to investigate as soon as possible: if our spies have heard rumors, surely someone else is also on the trail.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_EVENT_INTRO_ERIADU_AUTHORITY,Sander Delvardus: My most reliable agents have brought me rumors that the Katana Fleet has been found. Imagine the prestige of recovering that legendary fleet from the golden days of the Republic... Send an expedition to the navpoint. This operation has a higher priority than everything else, except securing exotic medical supplies.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_EVENT_INTRO_GREATER_MALDROOD,Treuten Teradoc: A lucrative trail has been followed from some of Neomen's art collection. It seems there has been a recent influx of items from the "lost" Katana Fleet. Someone had found it, and we have persuaded them to share. Take a fleet to the marker in Deep Space, and we'll see what can be collected from these ghost ships.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_EVENT_INTRO_HAPES_CONSORTIUM,Isolder: Interesting news reaches us. It seems there is a lost fleet of the Republic adrift in Deep Space. We are fortunate to hear word while it remains adrift. If we can move quickly, we might be able to secure a most useful collection of warships.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_EVENT_INTRO_HUTT_CARTELS,Troonol: A most curious whisper has begun to circulate: that the Katana fleet of the old Republic might not be so lost at all... Qunaalac is most interested in the prospect of recovering it if these are more than whispers. Send a fleet to the nav point as soon as possible.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_EVENT_INTRO_KILLIK_HIVES,Saras: An old memory ripples. The Joiners speak of warships lost to a disease, warships that await only someone who knows where they lie, and of someone who knows this thing. Lizil sees opportunity and has shared the where with you.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_EVENT_INTRO_PENTASTAR,Ardus Kaine: Surprising news, commander. An InQuestor brings word that the Katana Fleet may have been found. Were it from any other source I'd be sceptical, but I've authorized a probe to the alleged location. If there is a fleet to be claimed, let us ensure the Alignment is the one to do it.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_EVENT_INTRO_REBEL,Talon Karrde: Hey kid, the name's Talon Karrde. I've got some information on some frigates. Normally I wouldn't stick my head into galactic affairs like this, but let's just say I have my reasons for cooperating with you, for now. If you're interested, send a fleet to this location in deep space.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_EVENT_INTRO_SSIRUUVI_IMPERIUM,Ivpikkis: Word has reached us of a lost fleet, one that may have turned up near our borders as the prisoner would have it. Investigate this report, and if it can be trusted, take a task force to the marked beacon secure this prize.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_EVENT_INTRO_YEVETHA,Nil Spaar: Our agents have heard an intriguing piece of news. It seems our vile oppressors misplaced a fleet nearly two generations ago and it may have been found. Follow this news at the marked nav point and secure this fleet for the glory of N'zoth!
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_EVENT_INTRO_ZSINJ_EMPIRE,Zsinj: Some of our underworld friends tell intriguing news: the lost Katana Fleet was apparently stumbled upon by smugglers a few years ago. One of them has offered up a location. Send a fleet to investigate the Navpoint at once: I don't trust that we've made an exclusive deal.
TEXT_CONQUEST_LAMBDASECTOR_CSA_INTRO_ONE,Baruche Sloane: The way I see it, this sector is up for grabs. The Emperor and his pet dog Vader are dead. If anyone wants to waste what little assets they have left on a futile attempt to stop us, they can go right ahead and try!
TEXT_CONQUEST_LAMBDASECTOR_EA_INTRO_ONE,Sander Delvardus: The cursed Rebels have seized the hyperlanes to lock us. See if you can force a breakout on our eastern flank while I handle the fools at Sullust and Saijo. Eriadu's star shall rise once more!
TEXT_CONQUEST_LAMBDASECTOR_HUTT_INTRO_ONE,Borvo the Hutt: [Achuta, commander. The Kajidics have expressed some interest over this area of space in these chaotic times. Watch for any chances to increase our influence, but do not allow any upstart power to move against us.]
TEXT_CONQUEST_LAMBDASECTOR_IR_INTRO_ONE,Par Lankin: The chaos from the Emperor’s death proved worse than I feared. We've had to lay quiet while the Rebels run rampant, but they are concerned with other parts of the galaxy now. Scouts have been finding their weakness and our time to strike is fast approaching...
TEXT_CONQUEST_LAMBDASECTOR_KAMINO_INTRO_ONE,Dark Apprentice: Once again Kamino lies forgotten, holding a deadly secret. We are the knives in the dark, awaiting the right moment to reveal ourselves, to have our revenge...
TEXT_CONQUEST_LAMBDASECTOR_NABOO_INTRO_ONE,Moff Panaka: I am proud to have kept Chommell sector safe and secure as part of the Empire's effort to restore order to the galaxy and snuff out the fires of Separatism and factionalism. But now the Rebellion has returned the galaxy to anarchy, without a functioning central authority. Pirates operate with impunity in my home system, battleships in the skies of my home planet, droid soldiers killing people in our cities... we Naboo have seen invasions before. And I shall continue to defend my home to the best of my abilities, and at the risk of my own life.
TEXT_CONQUEST_LAMBDASECTOR_NABOO_SMEEL,Moff Panaka: Jenn Smeel was my trusted companion through the darkest days of the galaxy and Chommell Sector. His courage and advice will be sorely missed and without him we cannot organize special operations. [Storm Commandos have been disabled]
TEXT_CONQUEST_LAMBDASECTOR_NR_INTRO_ONE,Leia Organa: The Empire no longer exists, and its warlords are in retreat throughout the Trailing Sectors. Our forces control the Corellian Run in the Rim, and have cut off Prentioch and Delvardus. There are elements in the New Republic military who believe seizing the Emperor’s homeworld on Naboo would have symbolic value, and Moff Lankin is probing our territory. High Command is focused on other areas, but we need to keep the warlords in this area pacified.
TEXT_CONQUEST_LAMBDASECTOR_NR_NANTZ,Leia Organa: Admiral Nantz and General Taskeen have liberated Sullust and pushed near Glom Tho. We may be able to coax high command to divert them here before they drive into the Core.
TEXT_CONQUEST_LANDO_RESPAWN,Lando Calrissian: That's enough Star Destroyers shot out from under me. It's time to settle down and get back to business.
TEXT_CONQUEST_LUKE_NJO,Luke Skywalker: Without the Jedi Order of protectors to provide a backbone of strength for the New Republic, can we survive? Will we be able to weather the storms and the difficulties of forging a new union? I wish to establish a Jedi academy. Under my direction we can help students discover their abilities, to focus and strengthen their power. This academy would allow us to restore the Jedi Knights as protectors of the New Republic.
TEXT_CONQUEST_MALDROOD_CARNOR_INTRO,Treuten Teradoc: The Emperor is gone, but Maldrood lives. Kosh is attempting to hold our mid-rim territory, and I plan to take advantage of the disorganized forces in the core to establish our dominance.
TEXT_CONQUEST_MALDROOD_CSA_INTRO_E1,Treuten Teradoc: The real prizes to be picked from Zsinj's ruin are farther west, but there's some unprotected territory to be raided here first.
TEXT_CONQUEST_MALDROOD_DEEPCORE_INTRO,Kosh Teradoc: Welcome, Commander. Borders have been stabilized in my brother's territory, and the time has come to turn our attention back to the Core. We may even be able to transfer some of Treuten's outdated pink ships here if we have need of them.
TEXT_CONQUEST_MALDROOD_DEEPCORE_NH,Treuten Teradoc: Intelligence reports sightings of a new Super Star Destroyer. It would seem that the question of where all of Delvardus' resources have been going has been answered.
TEXT_CONQUEST_MALDROOD_HFZ_BREAKUP,Treuten Teradoc: It appears I was correct and the alliance has already begun to split. Zsinj's defeat has also meant an increased focus on ourselves as their primary enemy. We cannot allow them to gain any ground, so I have been forced to request the assistance of my brother Kosh and his forces.
TEXT_CONQUEST_MALDROOD_HFZ_INTRO,Treuten Teradoc: The traitor Rogriss and the Rebels appear to be making some form of alliance against Zsinj. We must act quickly and take advantage of the situation to expand our territory. If Zsinj is eliminated as a threat, that should also mean the end of the Rebel's alliance with Rogriss and the Ruling Council, turning the odds even more in our favour.
TEXT_CONQUEST_MALDROOD_INTRO_E1,Treuten Teradoc: With Crimson Command under my control I've broken off from that fool Zsinj and established power in the Maldrood Sector, and more Mid-Rim systems have sworn themselves to us since. With their militaries added to my own, the opposing systems are ripe for the taking, and my dashing command will easily set myself apart from the rest of the chaff jockeying for power.
TEXT_CONQUEST_MALDROOD_INTRO_E1_HINT,Conquer Kashyyyk (if present on this map) before another faction does to gain Peccati Syn (ISD-I) as a hero!
TEXT_CONQUEST_MALDROOD_INTRO_E2,Treuten Teradoc: Greater Maldrood is thriving under my dashing leadership! While my brother fancies himself a conqueror of old while fighting over petty scraps in Deep Core, Crimson Command has reaped bountiful plunder and victory. Now with Zsinj and Isard duking it out with both the Rebels and each other, our opportunity for conquest has never been greater!
TEXT_CONQUEST_MALDROOD_INTRO_E3,Treuten Teradoc: In spite of my bold leadership, the loathsome Rebels along with the traitorous dogs of the Ruling Council have pushed my fleet back. Yet, after some... negotiations, my brother Kosh and I have decided to fight towards each other, and with our combined military might the Federated Teradoc Union will be victorious!
TEXT_CONQUEST_MALDROOD_INTRO_E4,Treuten Teradoc: The dead apparently speak now; somehow, the Emperor has returned from the dead, and word has spread he's assembled a fleet to attack the Rebels. While neither Kosh nor I are convinced this isn't some mummers farce, this presents a prime opportunity for our forces to overwhelm our enemies while they are distracted.
TEXT_CONQUEST_MALDROOD_INTRO_E5,Kosh Teradoc: My impotent brother and his girly fleet have made fools of themselves in the Shadow Hand campaign, so I've sent him to keep guard of the Deep Core while I attempt to salvage our Mid-Rim holdings. We are in a grim position, but the Rebels have not fully recovered, and this Carnor Jax looks especially vulnerable if we can shore up support from other Imperials. With my superior skills in command, all is not yet lost for us.
TEXT_CONQUEST_MALDROOD_INTRO_E6,Treuten Teradoc: Crimson Command has suffered in the past years, but I am ready to reassert ourselves once more! All the petty warlords shall be trampled upon, and soon my vast fleet of frigates shall spill forth and wreak havoc across the New Republic. My arrogant runt of a brother thinks I am incapable, but I will show him!
TEXT_CONQUEST_MALDROOD_INTRO_E7,Kosh Teradoc: Treuten is... my brother is dead. We always wanted to prove ourselves superior over each other, but now that he's gone, it all seems so pointless. Now that treasonous cur Pellaeon, who has my brother's blood on his hands, claims to lead the Empire. I have only so much more fight left in me, but I swear to never submit to him or the rebel scum; if that means taking on the galaxy by myself, then so be it.
TEXT_CONQUEST_NR_INTRO_E5,Mon Mothma: Emperor Palpatine is gone, and the whole galaxy can breathe a sigh of relief. But our work is not done yet; a new Ruling Council has taken command of the Empire. New Republic Intelligence reports a man named Carnor Jax leads it, who has no desire for peace. Take command, and push the Empire back before they establish themselves further.
TEXT_CONQUEST_NR_INTRO_E6,Leia Organa Solo: The Empire is on the back foot, but the war is not over yet. I've heard from my husband an encounter he had near the Maw, and an unknown Imperial Admiral, Natasi Daala, has emerged from it with the intent to reunite the Empire. We may be in a position of strength but if she manages to unify the remaining Imperial states under her this could be disastrous. I'm putting my faith in you to handle this, Commander.
TEXT_CONQUEST_NR_INTRO_E7,Leia Organa Solo: Admiral Pellaeon has taken command of the Empire, and is prepared to launch a massive assault against the New Republic. Peace may be an option if we can push it back, but I have my doubts. Rally the fleets and match their advance, and we hopefully can end this war within our lifetimes.
TEXT_CONQUEST_OBJECTIVE_CONQUER_CORUSCANT_DESCRIPTION,Capture Coruscant from the New Republic. When you do so, the Emperor and the first World Devastator will join your forces at Byss.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ORINDA_ADUMAR_BOUNCE,[ Adumar has not yet made contact with the galaxy. ]
TEXT_CONQUEST_ORINDA_ADUMAR_UNLOCK_PELLAEON,Gilad Pellaeon: I've received reports that a previously unknown civilization on a planet on the western edge of the front has made contact with the rest of the galaxy. They wish to remain neutral, but their planet, Adumar, occupies a valuable strategic position. You have my permission to handle the situation as you see fit.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ORINDA_ADUMAR_UNLOCK_WEDGE,Wedge Antilles: A new civilization in the Adumar system has made contact with us. Their society idolizes fighter pilots, so they must be good people. They want to stay neutral, but they might not have a choice. Command has authorized you to decide how to deal with them. If you ask me, I think we should be nice.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ORINDA_ARETA_BELL_DEATH,Wedge Antilles: Endurance is lost, along with all hands onboard. Dammit Bell, why couldn't you just listen to me...
TEXT_CONQUEST_ORINDA_IR_INTRO,Gilad Pellaeon: We need a victory to recover our morale from the defeat at Yavin, so I've decided to retake Orinda. The New Republic doesn't know about the Star Dreadnoughts we recovered from Deep 3 - they will be our trump card. Once Orinda is taken, I'll give the order to deploy them and we'll push far enough to secure our new borders. This is to be a limited engagement - we're in no position to retake the galaxy, for now.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ORINDA_NR_INTRO,Gial Ackbar: Admiral Pellaeon has been quiet since he led the Imperial fleet out of the Deep Core, but I don't trust this silence. I'm assigning you to assist Admiral Bell in guarding our northern border.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ORINDA_ROGRISS_JOINS,Gilad Pellaeon: Now that we've taken our primary objective, it's time to deploy our secret weapons. Be careful with our Super Star Destroyers, Commander - they are irreplaceable.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ORINDA_WEDGE_JOINS,Wedge Antilles: Reaper may be a big girl, but we'll see how she does against someone her own size! Tycho and the Rogues are with me too, and they're ready to tangle with the 181st again!
TEXT_CONQUEST_OVERVIEW_ART_OF_WAR,This is an era-progressive galactic conquest with various events that can unlock as you progress. Planets that flash red are inaccessible and will be unlocked by events during the campaign.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_BALMORRAN_CONQUEST,Imperial Officer: The Balmorrans have been completely crushed. Several of their war machines have been confiscated as compensation for the trouble they've caused.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_BALMORRAN_REVOLT,Imperial Officer: The insolent Balmorrans have turned against us. Destroy any who stand in your path and seize their factories. Show them what it means to betray the Empire!
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_BOUNCE_OSH,Palpatine: I am handling the preparations at Byss personally. They need not concern you.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_CONQUER_CORUSCANT,Palpatine: For now, I command you to seize Coruscant. Once you have done so, I shall reveal my new weapons to the Galaxy.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_CORUSCANT_TAKEN,Palpatine: The Rebels had their chance... I gave them years to reclaim the galaxy, but they failed miserably. Now, you shall wield my discipline over the worlds that have betrayed me!
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_DEVASTATOR_UNLOCK,Palpatine: The testing of our new superweapon has been successful. The World Devastators have been operating with great effect in the Borderland Regions. You will now begin deploying them in our main assault forces.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_ECLIPSE_APPEARS,Palpatine: Fleets and armies are mere children's toys compared to the power of the Dark Side... But they have their uses. My flagship, the Eclipse, is at your disposal.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_IR_INTRO_DESCRIPTION,Emperor Palpatine has returned in a clone body. For the last several years he has been in hiding, building his strength and watching his subjects fight amongst themselves to weed out the weak. Now the time has come for him to unite the warlords and resume his rule over the galaxy.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_IR_INTRO_ONE,Palpatine: The foolish Rebels thought me defeated at Endor, but that was not the first time I died... Nor will it be the last! The time has come to punish these traitors for their impudence.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_IR_MUTINY,Palpatine: Those impatient fools have begun infighting while we make our preparations, weeding out the weak amongst them. 
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_LEIA_PLEA,Leia Organa: Whatever Palpatine did to him, I don’t believe Luke has gone over to the Dark Side fully. If I could just talk with him, I know I could bring him back! If he can be captured, I'll have that chance.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_LUKE_MISSION,Luke Skywalker: There's something wrong with the situation. I'm sensing a concentration of Dark Side energy in the Deep Core and must investigate. Hopefully I'll return with some answers.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_LUKE_MISSION_D,Leia Organa: I’m not sure what that… rupture was that swallowed Luke up, but it didn’t kill him. I’ve just received a message from him, warning me to stay away from the Deep Core. Luke told me he felt a great disturbance in the Force before the battle. I've got a bad feeling about this...
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_LUKE_RETURNED,Luke Skywalker: I never meant to go so far. I had to pretend to join Palpatine or die, but I was going to sabotage his war effort from within. Thank the Force Leia was able to get through to me. When I face Palpatine again, I'll be ready.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NEW_APPRENTICE,Palpatine: With Vader's betrayal, I require a new apprentice. One stronger than even Vader had the potential to be. You will bring me the son of Skywalker.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NEW_APPRENTICE_DONE,Palpatine: You have done well. Young Skywalker has been converted to the Dark Side, and is ready to lead our forces into battle.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NEW_APPRENTICE_LOST,Palpatine: It seems young Skywalker has failed to truly embrace the power of the Dark Side and has gone back the pathetic Rebels. No matter! He shall be crushed with the rest of the scum once and for all!
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NEW_BOSS_CARNOR,Carnor Jax: My moment has come at last. The galaxy will be mine. I will be more powerful than Vader, more powerful than even Palpatine!
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NEW_BOSS_LUKE,Luke Skywalker: My father's destiny is not my own - where he failed, I have succeeded. Palpatine is dead and now I am the Emperor!
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NEW_BOSS_SEDRISS,Sedriss: Until our Emperor returns again, it is our duty to carry out the orders he left for us. I'll destroy anyone who defies His Majesty's will!
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NR_DEVASTATORS,Mon Mothma: The Empire has unleashed another superweapon upon the galaxy, massive ‘World Devastators' that can devour both ships and planets.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NR_INTRO,Mon Mothma: This is an emergency, Commander. An Imperial fleet will arrive at Coruscant within hours - a fleet more powerful than any we believed to still exist. Our defenses can't hold, so I've ordered the evacuation. I fear there are dark days ahead of us.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NR_INTRO_DESCRIPTION,Coruscant has fallen to a reunited Galactic Empire and the leaders of the New Republic have withdrawn to the distant Da Soocha system. Something must be behind this renewed Imperial unity, but its true nature is unclear. If the New Republic is to survive, this new threat must be defeated.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NR_INTRO_ONE,Mon Mothma: Somehow, Emperor Palpatine has returned, with an enormous fleet of powerful warships at his command, including his flagship, the Eclipse. At his side is the Jedi Luke Skywalker, dressed in the armor of Darth Vader. The situation is worse than we could ever have feared.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NR_INTRO_TWO,Mon Mothma: Somehow, Emperor Palpatine has returned, with an enormous fleet of powerful warships at his command. The situation is worse than we could ever have feared. 
TEXT_CONQUEST_PENTASTAR_INTRO_E1,Ardus Kaine: I welcome your service Commander. Talks aboard my flagship with the major corporations of the region have concluded, and the Pentastar Alignment of Powers is now official. With their backing paired with our supporters from the Inquistorius the Alignment is poised to restore the broken glory of the Empire. We shall be the vanguard of the New Order, and the duty of eliminating its traitors falls to us.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PENTASTAR_INTRO_E2,Ardus Kaine: The Alignment is prospering and adamant against Zsinj and the Rebels needling, but the recent death of Inquisitor Jerec is a bitter loss. The ongoing chaos does present an opportunity for us to unleash our fleet and establish us as savior of the Empire; albeit I am hesitant to commit outward, and some in the Chamber of Order like Raquoran will bemoan any advance. I trust you will make the right decisions for the New Order.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PENTASTAR_INTRO_E3,Ardus Kaine: To my displeasure, Grand Admiral Grant has abandoned the Alignment. If that was not enough, another Grand Admiral has come out of the Unknown Regions and assembled a task force to face the New Republic. Discontent in our own ranks is growing as a result of his initiative, so I have made the call to rally the fleets; I will not be content to let another upstart shove my ambition aside.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PENTASTAR_INTRO_E4,Ardus Kaine: The Alignment has been dormant for too long, content to watch as usurpers fail to bring victory to the New Order. No more. An assault on the New Republic is planned amongst all remaining Imperial forces. I intend to lead our own fleet all the way to Coruscant, and a certain benefactor in the Deep Core has granted us one of Jerec's old flagships for use in our assault. Now let us show the galaxy the strength we have kept restrained for far too long.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PENTASTAR_INTRO_E5,Gregor Raquoran: That fool Kaine has leapt into his own grave! Now the Alignment lies leaderless; yet our industrial and military power remains unspoiled while the rest of the galaxy recovers itself. The Chamber of Order is trying to decide on who is leading us now, but I suggest, Commander, you secure our own territory in the meantime. The Velcar Sector is the highest priority, of course; just don't commit any suicidal gambits as Kaine did.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PENTASTAR_INTRO_E6,Elta Besk: The Empire is floundering, Commander, and the Chamber of Order's Moffs are begging for real leadership, which is where you come in. The Alignment's defeat would mean the New Republic's queer ideas for alien rights will likely be enforced on my and others' companies, which is unacceptable. It might prove necessary to unify with other Imperials if we wish to stake our claim outward, yet this will require a show of force and dominance over the remaining factions first.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REBEL_CSA_INTRO_E1,Admiral Ackbar: The Imperials and the Corporate Sector are at each other's throats. There aren't many Republic forces in this part of the galaxy, but we may be able to weather out this storm to our advantage.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REBEL_CSA_INTRO_E3,Mon Mothma: Dark times are upon us. Any day now we expect a fleet to descend on Mon Calamari and threaten to extinguish what little flame of the Rebellion yet burns. Our only consolation is that the slavers and robber barons of the Corporate Sector seem determined to resist a return to Imperial control.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REBEL_CSA_INTRO_E4,Admiral Ackbar: The time has come to deal with the shameless exploiters of the Corporate Sector. They have rejected every resolution condemning their immoral practices and every commission to expose their wrongdoing. The 'picket' fleets they're amassing make it clear violence is the only argument they will consider.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REBEL_CSA_INTRO_E7,Admiral Ackbar: Tread carefully, commander. One of our Jedi Knights, Toro Irana, has died under mysterious circumstances. Be ready to support Mander Zuma's investigation of the death. There also seems to be a wave of especially virulent spice circulating. Keep your nose open for any trace of that and any of the wretched smugglers who might be moving it.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_EA_GORGON_DESTROYED,Sander Delvardus: One of my rivals has been defeated, you say? ... Admiral who? Day-la? Dah-la? I've never heard of him; stop wasting my time!
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_EA_HINT_1,Sander Delvardus may be upgraded from Brilliant (Imperial-II Star Destroyer) to Night Hammer (Executor Star Dreadnought) at the Kampe shipyards.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_EA_HINT_2,If Admiral Daala's flagship, Gorgon, is not destroyed before the end of Cycle 20, she will appear at Tsoss Beacon with a fleet.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_EA_INTRO,Sander Delvardus: My rivals believe me beaten, but they underestimate my genius. They don't know that my new flagship, Night Hammer, nears completion in its secret drydock. It has all the latest technology - advanced slave-rigging, stealth plating, a medical stasis chamber... All that stands between me and the throne is a few thousand credits.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_EA_NIGHT_HAMMER,Sander Delvardus: At last, Night Hammer is complete! With this magnificent Super Star Destroyer at my command, I have become the ultimate power in the galaxy. In a matter of days, I shall be Emperor and the New Republic no more than a memory! All will bow before me or perish... And Seledra will be mine again.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_EA_TSOSS,Sander Delvardus: It seems Teradoc's mustachioed lackey has been playing postman, delivering invitations to some droll summit to the elite of the Deep Core. I've already declined, of course; I have no need to discuss anything with my inferiors.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_GENERIC_TSOSS_BOUNCE,[ There's nothing here worth stopping for. ]
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_GM_GORGON_DESTROYED,Treuten Teradoc: Good riddance to that upstart. As if I needed another rival.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_GM_HINT,If Admiral Daala's flagship, Gorgon, is not destroyed before the end of Cycle 20, you will lose Treuten Teradoc, Gilad Pellaeon, all forces and territory west of Manaan, and the ability to build Crimson Command Victory Star Destroyers. If Kosh Teradoc was defeated before this, he will return.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_GM_INTRO,Treuten Teradoc: Who does Kosh think he is, ordering me to Hakassi? There have been setbacks, yes, and Crimson Command has suffered casualties, but I could have handled it if those other ingrates supported us. Well, I'll show him. I'll defeat Harrsk, like he never could, and secure the entire Deep Core. Then we'll see who's begging who for help!
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_GM_TSOSS,Kosh Teradoc: Brother... You were a fool to set foot on that station. Daala... Pellaeon... You filthy traitors! I swear you will pay for this. Instead of flowers, I'll lay your skulls on Treuten's grave.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_HUTTS_INTRO,Durga Besadii Tai: My business ventures have prospered thanks to this long war, but these golden days may be over. At the rate the New Republic is gaining ground, the Empire will be finished in months. Then who will buy weapons from me? Hmm... If selling weapons is lucrative, can I use them myself for even greater profit? Let's find out.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_HUTTS_TSOSS,Durga Besadii Tai: Oh, it seems most of the Imperial warlords are dead. How interesting! I should have wagered on which would live longest.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_IR_BRIEFING,Bring Admiral Daala to the Tsoss system to reunite the Empire in the Deep Core.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_IR_HINT_1,After you bring Daala to Tsoss Beacon, the following will happen:
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_IR_HINT_2,- Blitzer Harrsk, Treuten Teradoc, Sander Delvardus, and Malfkla Yzu will be killed. Gilad Pellaeon (ISD-I), Ivan Cronus (CCVSD), Cinzero Gann (A6), and Noils (AT-AT) will join the Empire.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_IR_HINT_3,- All forces and territory of the Eriadu Authority will join the Empire. All forces and territory of the Greater Maldrood and Minor Warlords to the west of Manaan will join the Empire.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_IR_HINT_4,- The Empire will gain the ability to build Crimson Command VSD-IIs instead of regular VSD-IIs.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_IR_HINT_5,- The option to move Daala from Gorgon (ISD-I) to Knight Hammer (Executor Star Dreadnought) will become available at the Kampe shipyards.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_IR_INTRO_01,Natasi Daala: So this is what the Empire has been reduced to while I've been away. It seems every Star Destroyer captain thinks of themselves as the Emperor's heir. No more! I will remind every officer of their allegiance, and I swear on Tarkin's grave that I will execute all those who put ambition before duty!
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_IR_INTRO_02,Daala: If that smuggler I interrogated knew what he was talking about, there are two centres of Imperial power left in the galaxy. The Imperial forces in the Deep Core seem to be badly disorganized, so I will go there first to restore discipline.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_IR_TSOSS,Daala: I didn't want to rule. I had no intention of becoming a political leader. I wanted to crush the Rebels instead - but you warlords give me no choice. I cannot leave the Empire in the hands of fools like you.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_IR_TSOSS_BOUNCE,[ Only a force that includes Natasi Daala may stop here. ]
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_NR_GORGON_DESTROYED,Leia Organa Solo: My congratulations on destroying Admiral Daala's flagship, Commander. Unfortunately, Intel believes that she escaped the Gorgon before the reactor was breached. I sense that she's still out there, somewhere, and I fear that this setback will only strengthen her resolve.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_NR_HUTTS_HINT_1,At the end of Cycle 20, Admiral Daala will unite all Imperial forces remaining in the Deep Core and take command of Knight Hammer (Executor-class Star Dreadnought).
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_NR_HUTTS_HINT_2,- If Daala's flagship, Gorgon, is destroyed before the end of Cycle 20, this event will be delayed to the end of Cycle 30.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_NR_INTRO,Leia Organa Solo: Han told me all about his discovery of the Maw Installation and this Admiral Daala. For now, the Imperials are fighting amongst themselves, but I can sense Daala has the potential to reunite them. That makes her truly dangerous. The Senate agrees with me that we must eliminate her as a threat before she can bring our enemies together.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_NR_TSOSS,Leia Organa Solo: Our fears have come to pass. Intel reports that Admiral Daala has murdered the leading Imperial warlords of the Deep Core and taken command of their forces, creating the "United Warlord Fleets." Even worse, she seems to have pulled a new Star Dreadnought out of thin air, a jet-black Executor she's christened "Knight Hammer."
TEXT_CONQUEST_REUNIFICATION_UNIVERSAL_HINT,Imperial faction integration by normal means is disabled in this scenario.
TEXT_CONQUEST_TERRIK_VENTURE,Talon Karrde: Terrik told me he's going back to freelancing, but he's happy to work for you if you pay cash. If you'd like, I can contact him for you. No pressure, of course - I'm just trying to set you up with a good deal.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_IR_INTRO_ONE,Thrawn: Greetings, Commander, I am Grand Admiral Thrawn, the new head of all Imperial forces. My predecessors have proven themselves less than capable, however I trust you will not show similar inadequacies. History is on the move, Commander. Those who cannot keep up will be left behind, to watch from a distance. And those who stand in our way will not watch at all.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_IR_KATANA_INFO,Thrawn: In our recent efforts to capture Pantolomin, we came across one Hoffner who, according to Niles Ferrier, used to work with Jorj Car'das and Talon Karrde. He has given us the location of what he believes to be the Katana Fleet, at that location I have marked as Deep Space on your NavComp. Send a fleet led by myself to that location and we'll see if we can't use that fleet to our advantage, Commander.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_NKLLON_CONCLUSION,Thrawn: Exemplary work. Fifty-one mole miners ready to be converted into boarding craft. Monitor our intelligence channels for likely targets.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_NKLLON_INTRO,Thrawn: With Wayland’s technology, we now face a shortage of ships rather than crews. To that end, we should secure material to capture vessels from our foes. Nkllon in the Athega system will have a good quantity of mining equipment to repurpose.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_NR_INTRO_ONE,Mon Mothma: Greetings, Commander. I am Mon Mothma, Chief of State of the New Republic. The Senate has appointed you as the head of our armed forces in the fight against Grand Admiral Thrawn. We have very little knowledge about him, but recent reports have indicated he is a superb strategist, so caution is advised. In addition, rumors of a spy leaking information from Coruscant to him are causing discontent, so this threat must be dealt with quickly. May the Force be with you.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_NR_KARRDE_INFO,Talon Karrde: Hey kid, the name's Talon Karrde. I've got some information on some frigates. Normally I wouldn't stick my head into galactic affairs like this, but let's just say I have my reasons for cooperating with you, for now. If you're interested, send a fleet with me to the location in deep space.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_OBROA_CONCLUSION,Thrawn: Excellent work! The library indeed contains the location of Wayland, the Emperor's technological storehouse. There I expect to find the key to the only puzzle worth solving. The complete, total, and utter destruction of the Rebellion.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_OBROA_INTRO,Thrawn: Your first order is to secure the information library at Obroa-skai, commander. It may well hold the next piece of information key to my plans, which I've spent most of a year searching for.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_PANTOLOMIN_INTRO,Thrawn: Ferrier has found an intriguing lead on some derelicts. Secure Pantolomin so that we may follow these whispers where they might lead.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_TAKE_WAYLAND,Thrawn: Wayland has exceeded our hopes. It not only contains cloning devices that can be used to bolster our dwindling forces, but I have also secured the aid of the Dark Jedi guardian of Mount Tantiss.
TEXT_CONQUEST_WARLORDS_IR_INTRO_PESTAGE,Sate Pestage: The Rebels have been making inroads on our territory, and some of our own commanders have decided to abandon their duties, though they claim otherwise. I leave it to you to reunite my Empire. The Warlord filth are no different from the Rebels. Ensure the Empire is victorious on all fronts.
TEXT_CONQUEST_WARLORDS_NR_INTRO_MOTHMA,Mon Mothma: The Emperor may be defeated, but our work is far from over. Many systems still remain under Imperial oppressors. Fortunately, the Imperials have begun infighting. We must take advantage of this opportunity.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_BACTA_INTRO_ONE,Zsinj: It appears that after the blasted Rebels took Coruscant they started shifting their attention to us. We'll have to act fast to build our defenses and push for the core ourselves.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_CSA_INTRO_E1,Warlord Zsinj: More urgent matters on my other borders take my attention, but I have full confidence in your ability to handle this theater, commander.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_CSA_INTRO_E3,Bock Nabyl: It's hopeless! With Zsinj dead, our empire has descended into chaos and madness! Deserters, invaders, chaos... Zsinj's legacy won't last the month.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_HFZ_BREAKUP_NR,Han Solo: Great work kid, we've taken out Zsinj. Don't get too comfortable though, the Imperials have called off the truce and look like they're about ready to start fighting again.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_HFZ_DEATH,Moff: Unfortunately sir, the death of our leader has sent our forces into disarray. The Corporate Sector has used the confusion to throw off our control. However, the Rebels and Ruling Council have once again begun fighting and ended their own alliance, so hope is not lost.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_HFZ_INTRO,Warlord Zsinj: I require your assistance. The Rebel General Han Solo and the ruling council have decided to align against us, while that blasted earworm Teradoc and his forces are looking to scavenge from the remains. This cannot be allowed to happen. We will kill General Han Solo and as many of his friends and aides as is humanly possible. I leave it to you, commander.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_INTRO_E1,Warlord Zsinj: The Emperor's death has finally provided me with an opportunity to prove myself as the real power in this galaxy. Already, many systems have flocked to my control. The only foible in my plans is that impertinent blob Teradoc, who has run off with Crimson Command and locked my good friend Ambris Selit under house arrest. While I would love to teach him a lesson, he is but one of the enemies that surround us. I trust you will pursue the right priorities, Commander.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_INTRO_E1_HINT,Conquer Centares (if present on this map) before another faction does to gain Ambris Selit (Economic) as a hero!
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_INTRO_E2,Warlord Zsinj: The Corporate Sector has been effectively vassalized and the Rebels' advances against me have been thwarted. As if things could not get any better, Isard has overthrown Pestage, throwing Imperial Center and the rest of the Core into disarray. The time has never been better for me to seize my place as rightful successor to the Empire!
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_NR_HAPES_ONE,Leia Organa: You must be the one Han's been talking about. I believe I may be able to get us new allies in our fight against the Empire. Send me to the Transitory Mists and I should be able to convince the Hapes Consortium to join our fight. I need to go alone, or the Hapans may take it as a declaration of war.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_NR_HAPES_THREE,Leia Organa: I've returned, commander. I was able to convince the Hapans to join us. Prince Isolder and his fleet should now be under your command. May the force be with you.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_NR_HAPES_TWO,Leia Organa: I am in contact with the Hapan government. I'll return to Coruscant when I've spoken to the royal family.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_NR_INTRO_ONE,Han Solo: Is this thing on? This is General Solo; I'm in charge of the force going after that hawk-bat Zsinj. We've made a truce with the Imperials for now, so they won't attack us as long as we don't attack them.

TEXT_GOVERNMENT_HAPAN_DESCRIPTION_1,The Hapan government must balance the competing interests of several noble Houses. Building anything on a planet with a House land title or House shipyard will give you +1 favour with that House. If the same House has both a land title and a shipyard on a planet, you will gain +2 favour with that House for each thing built there.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_HAPAN_DESCRIPTION_2,Each House has a unique infantry type that can be recruited on planets with their land titles. Each company of House infantry that you build gives +1 favour with that House, on top of the favour from the land title (and shipyard, if applicable). You can spend House favour to recruit field and fleet commanders from specific Houses on the political options tab.

TEXT_LORE_IMPERIAL_MUTINY_DESCRIPTION,In the years leading up to Shadow Hand, Imperial forces from all over the galaxy began to disappear without a trace, having been called to Palpatine's side as he was preparing his assault from the deep core. While the initial attacks by these forces in 10 ABY were successful, they soon began infighting, a process which Palpatine believed would weed out the weak. Among the casualties from what would be called the Imperial Mutiny were multiple of the Super Star Destroyers which had disappeared to and set out from the Deep Core- Whelm (Executor-class) and Panthac (Mandator-III-class) which destroyed each other at Alsakan, Javelin (Vengeance-class) which rammed a torpedo sphere defending Chasin, and the Aculeus (Mandator III-class), which was destroyed by TIE Droid squadrons over Drearia.
TEXT_LORE_LIINADE_CONQUEST,Conquest of Liinade III
TEXT_LORE_LIINADE_CONQUEST_DESCRIPTION,The battle at Liinade III became a focus of propaganda for both sides after plans for a Death Star-like superweapon were found in its aftermath. These plans rapidly replaced the murder of Sate Pestage as the reason to bring Delak Krennel to justice. For his part, the Prince-Admiral claimed that the plans were planted and that he would never develop such a horrible device. Krennel had been talking with the survivors of Alderaan regarding the establishment of a haven for them, and he sorrowfully announced to the galaxy that he had had Liinade III in mind as its location. In reality, the plans were a counterfeit of the real Ysanne Isard, who used the subsequent investigation to her advantage.
TEXT_LORE_REQUIEM_SQUADRON,Requiem Squadron
TEXT_LORE_REQUIEM_SQUADRON_DESCRIPTION,In the ambush at Distna, a moon of Corvis Minor V, Rogue Squadron was nearly destroyed by a wing of TIE fighters. But two squadrons of TIE Defenders intervened and took the surviving Rogues to the base of a secretive Imperial organization. This group sent the Rogues to Ciutric in a TIE Defender squadron, posing as Requiem Squadron led by one of Wedge Antilles' old aliases, Antar Roat. A message dispatched to the New Republic High Command detailed the timetable of their sabotage mission.
TEXT_LORE_TSOSS_CONFERENCE,Lore Holocron: Tsoss Conference
TEXT_LORE_TSOSS_CONFERENCE_DESCRIPTION_1,Upon her arrival in the Deep Core, Admiral Daala was horrified to discover that the Imperial leaders there were fighting each other instead of the New Republic. She found an ally in Vice-Admiral Pellaeon, who had fallen in with the warlord Treuten Teradoc after the collapse of the Dark Empire.
TEXT_LORE_TSOSS_CONFERENCE_DESCRIPTION_2,With Pellaeon's assistance, Daala called a meeting of thirteen Imperial leaders in the uninhabited Tsoss system. The most prominent of these leaders were Blitzer Harrsk, Treuten Teradoc, Sander Delvardus, and Malfkla Yzu; the names of the rest are lost to history.
TEXT_LORE_TSOSS_CONFERENCE_DESCRIPTION_3,The warlords were initially unwilling to discuss anything, but Daala was an unconventional negotiator - she sealed the conference room's only exit with a blast door on a three-hour automatic timer. As the timer ticked down, the discussion devolved from acrimony to outright violence; in the third hour, Harrsk leapt across the table and fell upon Treuten Teradoc in an attempt to strangle him to death.
TEXT_LORE_TSOSS_CONFERENCE_DESCRIPTION_4,With this outburst, Daala determined it was time to employ her other unconventional diplomatic tool. Pellaeon and Daala had secretly brought their own gas masks into the conference room, but the gathered warlords weren't so well prepared. When Daala released the poison gas, everyone in the room except Daala and Pellaeon were killed.
TEXT_LORE_TSOSS_CONFERENCE_DESCRIPTION_5,The deceased warlords' surviving forces didn't mourn their loss and quickly fell into line behind Daala and Pellaeon, forming the "United Warlord Fleet."

TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_25_INTRO_E,This Rebellion has subverted many of the outlying systems of the galaxy and the Empire is in dire peril of losing Coruscant. Imperial forces have pulled back and fortified the Core Worlds, but it is only a matter of time before the Rebels begin their assault. A sum total of 9,000 credits has been made available to you. Rebuild the Imperial Navy, destroy the Rebels, and protect the Emperor at all costs.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_30_INTRO_E,Imperial forces have managed to flee to the fringes of the galaxy. Due to the strain of war and mismanagement by corrupt Imperial officials, you have only 5,000 credits left to retake the Core Worlds and the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_35_INTRO_E,The Empire has underestimated the resourcefulness of the Rebellion. While we were fighting battles on the outer rim, several Core worlds have fallen to Rebel attacks. As a result, Imperial forces have been fractured.

We need a strong leader, one who can best the Rebels and force these ambitious warlords to unite under one banner again. You can join me, or be sure to fall with him.
TEXT_STORY_IR_ERA_2_PROJECT_AMBITION_FAILURE,If a different faction takes Coruscant, or Sate Pestage dies before completing either of the above options:
TEXT_STORY_IR_ERA_2_PROJECT_AMBITION_ISARD,- Isard's regime will assume control of the Galactic Empire.
TEXT_STORY_IR_ERA_2_PROJECT_AMBITION_RESULT,- PROJECT AMBITION: Ysanne Isard will come under your command with a roster of heroes, and Thyferra will join the Galactic Empire. Isard may be upgraded to Lusankya (Executor Star Dreadnaught) at the Imperial Capital.
TEXT_STORY_IR_ERA_2_PROJECT_AMBITION_SUCCESS,If enacted before Coruscant falls or Sate Pestage is killed:
TEXT_STORY_IR_ERA_2_PROJECT_AMBITION_ZEROCOMMAND,- Zero Command will take control of the following planets if the Galactic Empire controls them. [ Kalist VI, Abregado-Rae ]

TEXT_TOOLTIP_1H_TANK,The biggest and toughest variant of the Imperial repulsortank line, it was also the most widely produced by its manufacturer Ubrikkian Transports. Sporting weaponry that rivaled artillery in range and power, its durable armor allowed it to withstand sustained fire even from other heavy assault vehicles. The 1-H's lumbering size and speed means only the most highly trained and specialized tank crews can pilot them effectively.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_1L_TANK,An economical version of the standard Imperial repulsortank, and a by-product of Colonel Zel Johans' push to standardize the Imperial Army's use of repulsor vehicles. Usually crewed by two standard army troopers under strict supervision of sergeants by comlink. Without the expensive heavy gun intended for the standard garrison tank it is unable to match up against equitable vehicles on the field, but gains in speed and usage against infantry in exchange.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_CANDEROUS_TANK,Produced by MandalMotors and a favorite among criminal groups with credits to spare, the Canderous-class assault tank is a powerful war machine. Heavy mass-driver cannons and a concussion missile launcher make it suited to take on nearly any target, and it has the armor and shielding to take what it gives out in exchange. Its repulsor-capabilities allow the Canderous to reach portions of the battle inaccessible to other vehicles of its weight class. Its major weakness is a slow and lumbering speed which could allow the vehicle to be outmaneuvered and flanked easily if lacking in proper support.

They briefly worked as mercenaries, striking at Imperials and getting revenge on Captain Dadefra for his role in their massacre, but turned pirate again with the death of Palpatine. Allying with Leonia Tavira's Invids, the group would provide some of her best clutch pilots, with Bolt Squadron being the most prestigious. Leadership in the squad is elected amongst its members, a tradition for all officers in the Survivors.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_CLYNGUNN,With the collapse of the Empire and the subsequent chaos surrounding the ex-Imperial generals and warlords fighting over the remnants, as well as penalties for smuggling growing stiffer, it became difficult for a smuggler to make a living.

His nostalgia over the glory days of the clone army went so far that Cody refused to abandon his old armor, and in his private thoughts Cody admitted that the days he served alongside the Jedi were the best of his life.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_COMPFORCE_ASSAULT,Assault Troopers are soldiers of CompForce, the military branch of COMPNOR, and are rabid zealots more loyal to the ideology of the Empire over any officer or military institution. Assault Troopers are given priority in new gear and equipment, to the consternation of the Army, and undergo ferocious casualties in training that instill in them a willingness to fight on regardless of casualties. This mostly ensures those who are lucky to actually survive are processed to deployment over those with innate combat skills, which shows in the high casualty and failure rates Assault Troopers endure. These deficiencies are considered unimportant due to the vast reserves CompForce has available.

However it would largely be due to her father's fame that Tessala would be able to fight against the rampant sexism of the Empire in order to become a Major General and be one of the few high ranking female Officers in the Imperial Army. Her experience would lead to her creating the Firebird Society in order to prove the worth of women to the Imperial army.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_CRIMSON,Crimson Command is a fleet of Victory-II Star Destroyers led by High Admiral Teradoc.

Sharing Daala's ambition to unite the Empire, Cronus became one of her most trusted advisors.

Vader would be captured, but the Dark Apprentice would wait patiently for the return of his master so he could fulfill his purpose and clash with the rival clone. Yet it would not come to pass.

Assumed dead, these stormtroopers had instead been retrieved by agents of the Reborn Palpatine and then experimented on with Dark Side alchemy within his citadel. Those who survived were forcibly reformed into elite soldiers with limited force powers and increased vitality. These Dark Stormtroopers are both deadlier than normal stormtroopers and stripped of any potential for disloyalty and life outside the cogs of the Emperor's war machine.

Lemelisk was mostly succeessful: the Darksaber's superlaser can vaporize nearly any ship or space station, though it falls short of destroying planets. Unfortunately, due to design shortcomings and low-quality construction, Darksaber is incredibly unstable and dangerous to friend and foe alike.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_DAUNTLESS,A sleek and battle-ready SoroSuub cruiser design built on a luxury liner hull that dates to the high point of the Galactic Civil War.

Declann specialised in Battle Meditation, a power which he used aboard the Death Star II at the end of his life.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DEFENDER,A modern descendant of the older Incom ATL Interceptor, the Defender-class starfighter is an early part of the New Class Modernization Project. The design is a symptom of the logistics requirements of a galactic power, needing a relatively cheap starfighter to be deployed en-masse for defense and supporting specialized New Class vessels. The end result is superior to the older TIE/ln.

While Thaffe perished Nataz and Goa escaped, with Nataz setting a freighter to crash into Jabba's asteroid palace on their way out, earning him the nickname 'Megadeath.' Both Nataz and Goa were relieved of duty in the scandal that followed, with Jabba setting a bounty on both.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_E_WING,Extremely well-rounded interceptor reminiscent of the X-wing and similarly armed. The fighter's use was hampered by a poor first production model and teething issues with the weapons systems, but it is now one of the New Republic's most effective snubfighters. It is able to handily perform any combat role in a fleet action.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_E_WING_PROTOTYPE,The initial production model of the E-wing snubfighter. While a capable interceptor in its own right, it is armed only for anti-fighter duty, leaving it without the multi-role capability of the X-wing until later models adjusted its weapon layout.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_ECLIPSE,The first in a new line of Star Dreadnaughts, the Eclipse was designed to Palpatine's exact specifications as his flagship. While scoffed at by naval planners who simply saw it as an oversized yacht, the reality was that Eclipse would be the latest in a long line of the Emperor's superweapons. Its ebony hull bears modernized weapon improvements, including numerous laser cannons and gravity well projectors. The most important of these is a spine-mounted coaxial superlaser modeled on the main weapon of the Death Star, with enough power to shatter planetary shields and turn continents to slag.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_FIRE_DRAGON,The Fire Dragon tank is a rare purpose built design for the Hapan military rather than a civilian conversion. Doctrine dictates the Fire Dragon is deployed in swarms where its heavy weapons are capable of rapidly destroying even the heaviest of enemy armour before return fire is able to break through the vehicle’s shielding and hit on the relatively weak armour. The lack of armour was a conscious design choice to allow for greater mobility so the Fire Dragon could retreat to safety when its shielding is under threat of breaking.

Some estimates placed the weapon as being on par with the turbolasers of an ISD in terms of firepower, although it had a terrible recharge rate, which allowed the MAS to crack any defence or even target capital ships in the atmosphere. Smaller turbolasers and lasers protected the platform from any threats attempting to get close.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_NEBULA,A modernized and compact Star Destroyer developed by the New Republic with a history in the Defender Program, supplanting the unpopular Republic-class. Very well armed for its size, the Nebula excels at destroying enemy capitals behind the coverage of more durable designs or from a flanking position. Despite the sheer firepower it is still less massive than even a Victory-class and does not hold up against vessels larger than itself in head to head combat.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_NEBULON_B,A Kuat-designed escort frigate originally intended to safeguard Imperial convoys against raids by early rebel groups.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_NEBULON_B_PATROL,Originally intended for convoy escort duties, the basic Nebulon-B design received countless adaptations as Imperials and Rebels alike sought to use the cheap but versatile frigate to meet different needs. This Imperial-designed patrol variant replaces some of the base design’s turbolaser and laser output with ion cannons. These ion weapons are a direct counter to the New Republic’s reliance on strongly shielded ships and fighters and noticeably improves the frigate's capabilities against shielded targets.

It features a Hellcaster cannon, a specialized repeating slugthrower capable of ripping through barriers with ease, along with missile launchers.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_NEUTRON,Hapan culture was traditionally heavily isolationist and for much of its history the Hapan people had been left alone by the wider galaxy. However this changed with the rise of the Empire which made frequent incursions into the Cluster with significant force. This new threat led the Hapan Royal Navy to accept a new larger ship design which moved away from standard Hapan doctrine of massed firepower to a ship more capable of brawling with a peer opponent in equal battle. While not successful enough to shift Hapan doctrine wholesale the Neutron was still a valuable addition to the Navy, capable of drawing enemy fire away from the massed cruisers and small ships.

Darth Vader would earn the fanatic loyalty of these warriors with the false promise to heal their homeworld of Honoghr, and Grand Admiral Thrawn would gain their loyalty as well before this deception was revealed. Operating as a special forces unit within the Imperial Army, Death Commandos were famously used in assassinations of the Empire's targets as well as the rescue of captured personnel.

Even when such commissions dried up, Oberos was eager to test his mettle, and took up a job on Cato Neimoidia hunting owners of a Jedi holocron, but supposedly perished there. Oberos later resurfaced as an enforcer for the Hutt Cartels, flying a Kimogila fighter instead of his old StarViper MK2. Rumors were abound that he had came back disfigured or had illegal cybernetics, while others claim this was not the man who fell on Cato Neimoidia at all.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_OTRO,An executive of Galentro Heavy Works, Wyrn Otro was raised on a Galentro family enclave in the Core like most elite members of the corporation. Otro would serve as Galentro's representative at Grand Moff Kaine's Pentastar Talks, and despite his misgivings that it was a power play by Kaine, helped ratify the Pentastar Alignment Treaty. While a member of the Alignment's Chamber of Order along with other corporates, he prioritizes Galentro over anything else, viewing the corporation as the only family he needed.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_OTTO,A renegade Imperial General, Otto earned his rank from his political connections and friendship with Admiral Motti. Repeated defeats and rumors of spice addiction saw Otto reassigned to Lok where Motti hoped his friend would keep a low profile. Out of wanderlust Otto would abandon his post, taking an AT-ST walker to participate in Jabba the Hutt's demolition games in hopes to gain the money needed to retire to Cloud City. His obese and bumbling nature is matched only by his insane zealotry to the Emperor, granting him startling capability in combat.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_OWEN,An extremely vain and short tempered Moff; Owen was the governor of the Rayter Sector in the Galactic Civil War. Owen would lose his position due to the scheming and treachery of his personal assistant. Relegated to the command of his ISD, Impending Doom, Owen would go on a rampage of revenge and executions to regain his honour and position in the Empire.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_PALPATINE_REBORN,Emperor Palpatine had conquered death through the Dark Side long ago, yet was unprepared for his demise at Endor. His spirit was adrift before his consciousness returned to a clone on Byss, and the ordeal forced the Emperor to enter a period of convalescence. He was not idle, as this time was used to prepare his legions and superweapons, while growing even stronger in the Dark Side through his studies. Now fully recovered, Palpatine aims to subjugate the galaxy once more, and usher in an empire of darkness across the stars.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_PARALLAX_ARTILLERY,The Parallax Artillery System is an adaptation of the militarised version of the Water Dragon transport where the internal space and external weapon systems were stripped out to provide munitions storage and targeting computers for the massive torpedo launcher system installed on top of the vehicle. Because it is a conversion and not a purpose-built artillery design, the Parallax has to deploy stabilisers before firing in order to stay upright against the recoil forces.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_PARNELL,Sebastian Parnell was an Imperial Army General and the Governor of the Sil’Lume System under the Empire. The Governor-General was in personal charge of protecting the asteroid mining which occurred in the system and the prisons on the third planet. Parnell was extremely brutal in his tactics and was happy to spill as much blood as needed to achieve his goals, and probably a bit more blood than that just to make sure. 
TEXT_TOOLTIP_PARNET,An Imperial General stationed on High Inquisitor Tremayne's flagship, the Interrogator. Baring a face that looked as handsome as it did cruel, Parnet lived in terror of Tremayne, a common sentiment amongst the Interrogator's crew. When Captain Vharing boasted of his ability to persist in his post, Parnet warned him there was only one penalty for failure to the High Inquisitor; the longest fall a man could take, death. His words would be proven true when Vharing was unceremoniously executed by Tremayne shortly thereafter.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_PATROL_MIYTIL,Developed with the help of Separatist engineers fleeing the Clone Wars, the Miy'til was an extremely cheap and miniaturised fighter that was the predominant fighter of the Hapes Consortium during the Galactic Civil war and after and served in several variants.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_PESTAGE,One of the earliest supporters of Palpatine and Grand Vizier of the Empire, Sate Pestage's power in the New Order allowed him to give or deny access to the Emperor at will on top of managing his personal archives. Pestage also increasingly took part in the ruling of the Empire as Palpatine withdrew from the concerns of the state for arcane matters. With the Emperor's death, Pestage took the role of ruler of the Empire for a time. He would attempt to raise Imperial citizens morale through acts such as establishing the Church of the Dark Side as a state religion. Conflicts with both Isard and the Imperial Advisors would see Pestage deposed however, with mixed reports of him being assassinated on his homeworld of Ciutric, to simply retiring to the sanctuary world of Byss.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_PHALANX,The Phalanx was initially designed alongside the Intego by the Chiss Ascendancy in response to growing aggression in the unknown regions. Despite tensions between the two factions, both had heavy input from the Empire of the Hand.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SCIMITAR,Designed by Sienar under Tomax Bren's proposal for a TIE Bomber Mark 2, the Scimitar assault bomber has improved durability, shielding and faster speed compared to the TIE Bomber at the cost of a leaner payload.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_AGGRESSOR,A multirole TIE fighter equipped with missiles and a rear turret. Its panel design allows for turret coverage at the expense of power management, reducing speed and potential firepower.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_AVENGER,An improvement upon the TIE Advanced used by Darth Vader, the TIE Avenger was designed to replace the Interceptor though the cost prevented widespread use.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_AVENGER_AVENGER,Elite pilots of the Imperial fighter group Avenger Squadron. Unique in the amount of liberties they were afforded, the pilots of Avenger Squadron were free to modify their craft with an assortment of tech under the supervision of their commander E.C. "Easy" Nerwal such as enhanced shields and jamming systems. The veteran members of Avenger Squadron would adorn their TIE Interceptors with two vertical white stripes to distinguish themselves, a tradition that continued when they were outfitted with TIE Avengers in the Airam sector campaign.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_BOMBER_SCIMITAR_SQUADRON,TIE Bombers of the elite Scimitar Squadron, typically assigned to attack secondary targets and provide cover to allied forces. Scimitar Squadron would be stationed on the Death Star II to provide ground support to the Endor shield generator, but were unable to intercept the Rebel infiltration due to the simultaneous assault in orbit. The battle along with the stations destruction saw many of its members perish, but since then Rhymer along with Captain Jonus have replenished its numbers with new blood.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_CRAWLER,Also known as the "Century Tank", this medium tank was intended to make use of surplus TIE components and production lines. The use of starship-grade components provides surprising durability. Its cockpit-mounted, low-slung weaponry makes it a poor choice on uneven terrain, but in an open field provide, its hefty firepower matches other tanks.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_DEFENDER,The brainchild of Grand Admiral Demetrius Zaarin along with the TIE Avenger, the TIE Defender was an evolution of the TIE series intended to counter the Rebel Alliance's starfighter doctrine. It was built to have innate deflector shielding, a hyperdrive engine, excellent speed, and an armament featuring laser and ion cannons, plus a torpedo launcher. As a result the Defender is one of the deadliest fighters in the Empire's arsenal, and only the extreme cost of the craft prevented it from being deployed in mass quantities.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_DEFENDER_ONYX,Remarked upon by Rexler Brath as "either the best pilots, or the luckiest," the men of Onyx Squadron are some of the longest surviving pilots from the initial deployment of the TIE Defender. The barrier of entry for the first generation of TIE Defender squadrons was exceptionally high, as only pilots who survived at least 20 combat missions would be considered for assignment.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_DEFENDER_SWORD,Created after the formation of the Galactic Empire, Sword Squadron began its career pacifying the Western Reaches and maintaining Imperial control in the area. Under fighter ace and commander Shea Hublin, Sword Squadron flourishes, as his expertise in dogfighting surpasses most rivals.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_DROID,A droid fighter that first saw use during the Shadow Hand campaign. Developed from advances in General Lott's slave-rigged walker system, that allows the TIE/D to operate through onboard droid brains or remotely controlled computer-slaving systems. Its comparable performance to the standard TIE/LN marks it as a significant step in the development of a fully automated Imperial military, and in numbers serve as a threat to even large warships.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_FIGHTER_ALPHA,Present at the Battle of Endor, Alpha Squadron was one of several highly elite TIE Fighter squadrons assigned to patrol both Death Stars and escort Emperor Palpatine across the galaxy before the Royal Guard Interceptors took over. After the Battle of Endor, Lumiya took command of Alpha Squadron and assigned them to her own personal entourage.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_FIGHTER_OBSIDIAN,Modified TIE Fighters under the command of Cive Rashon designed to intercept pirates and raiders inside and outside of atmosphere. Obsidian Squadron served loyally as members of Death Squadron, participating in the Occupation of Bespin and the Battle of Endor at the behest of Vader.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_GT,An original Sienar bomber in the early days of the New Order. Its small payload made it unpopular, leading to its quick replacement by the TIE Bomber. Though clumsier than a standard TIE Fighter and only possessing a single heavy laser cannon, the missile launcher of the TIE/gt can be useful in a fighter role.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_HEAVY_BOMBER,A straightforward and modular development of an ordinary TIE Bomber that sports twice the weapon pods for twice the ordnance, at a cost of maneuverability and target profile.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_HUNTER,A speedy, heavily armed fighter originally designed for use by the Storm Commandos. It performs similarly to the ubiquitous X-wing it imitates but is more suited to engaging enemy capital ships.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_INTERCEPTOR,An extremely fast and maneuverable interceptor. Originally intended to replace the TIE/ln but relegated to supplementing it instead due to logistical problems. Armed with laser cannons, it is an extremely deadly threat to Rebel starfighters in a dogfight.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_INTERCEPTOR_181ST,A hand-picked group comprised of the finest pilots at the Galactic Empire's disposal, the 181st is the pinnacle of the Imperial Starfighter Corps. The famous bloodstripes that adorn their starfighters are indicators of their lethal efficiency, confirming that each pilot has at least 10 confirmed kills in the name of the Empire.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_INTERCEPTOR_BLACK_WING,Commanded by Lieutenant Creb and styled after the famous Rogue Squadron, Black Wing Squadron formed under the guidance of Thrawn, and functions as his personal starfighter escort. To be more comparable to Rogue Squadron, Creb had Black Wing's starfighters shielded, giving them the survivability to establish that same veterancy Rogue Squadron enjoys.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_INTERCEPTOR_ELITE,Fervently loyal to Director Ysanne Isard to the bitter end, the pilots of Elite Squadron serve Isard's interests and exclusively take orders from her. Comprised of capable pilots that are under Isard's thumb, Elite Squadron enforces her iron will and undertakes sensitive operations including intelligence gathering and subterfuge.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_INTERCEPTOR_FALSE_181ST,Partially comprised of genuine 181st veterans and mediocre pilots from Zsinj's personal starfighter corps, the human pilots of this False 181st don't know that Tetran Cowall is not actually Soontir Fel. Tetran's true identity is kept under lock-and-key by Zsinj, to prevent New Republic spies from learning of the true nature of the squadron.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_LIGHTDUTY,Often made from repaired TIE series fighters that are no longer suited for front line services. The TIE Light Duty is often used for training flights or used to fill out the numbers on backwater planets where it was not expected to face any serious threat. The TIE Light Duty should only be used in serious combat if there are no other options available for deployment.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_MAULER,A fast light assault vehicle. Its purpose-built design intended to cash in on the ground vehicle market for Sienar. It earned its common name by being used to roadkill infantry and civilian formations. It lacks the material quality and durability of the Century tank, and its cockpit lasers make it best used to close in against infantry or on flat terrain.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_MAULER_COMPANY,Company: 4x TIE Mauler
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_MAULER_HEALTH,Health: 100 (Medium Vehicle)
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_MAULER_MOVE,Speed: 3.0 | Turn: 4.0 
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_MAULER_WEAP1,3x AI Blaster Cannons: 2 / 0.5s / 240m
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_OPPRESSOR,A maneuverable light bomber introduced after the Battle of Yavin. Compared to the TIE/sa Bomber, it lacks anti-ship munitions but is faster, more durable, and more able to defend itself from fighters.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_PUNISHER,A long-range attack bomber meant to cripple ships and installations. It is a large, cumbersome, and expensive but incredibly powerful craft that carries four times the ordinance of a standard TIE Bomber.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_RAPTOR,Developed by engineers serving under Warlord Zsinj, the TIE Raptor is a highly effective combat starfighter. While technically not a proper TIE because Sienar Fleet Systems had no hand in its design or production that has no impact on its performance. It has a strong weapon loadout for its role with fast-firing laser cannons and concussion missile launchers, and while lacking in the acceleration of the TIE Interceptor has maneuverability on par with the A-wing. The TIE Raptor is commonly unshielded, but some experimental shielded variants have been developed.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_SCOUT,A long-range scout fighter armed with light laser cannons. What it lacks in firepower, it makes up for in speed, maneuverability, and armor. It can safely scout areas more quickly than any other ship.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_SENTINEL,A novel TIE variant based around a pair of heavy turrets. Though somewhat clumsy, the Sentinel's shield and sturdy hull allow it to stay intact while the turrets engage nimbler foes. The Sentinel is famous beyond its deployment due to being the subject of the painting Emperor's Eyes.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_TERROR,A long-range special forces assault fighter originally made for Darth Vader's Terror Project. With an equivalent armament to a TIE Bomber, it is also equipped with experimental shields and faster engines. Capable of engaging any target.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_V1,Early models of advanced TIE that would eventually evolve into the more typical and common /x1 design. Recognizable by a more compact wing configuration, the sleek design emphasizes speed more than the durability of later iterations, relegating it to an expensive interceptor. Generally handed out to favoured servants and forces among the Empire's numerous branches, as opposed to naval fleets.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_X1,One of the most famous heavier TIE models, said to be made by Raith Sienar himself at the request of Darth Vader. A heavier frame and integrated shield generator result in a more robust but less manueverable design that saw limited production compared to other models, though in significantly higher numbers than officially reported.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_X2,A medium fighter that was the intermediary design between the TIE Advanced and TIE Avenger. Saw limited production and assignment after a trial period which received glowing reviews from pilots. The durability and munitions make it a more suitable counterpart to the X-wing fighters.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_X3,Test bed TIE design that incorporated swept-in wing panels and improved propulsion systems, while staying closer to the basic TIE/ln systems then the heavier, costlier /x1 and X-2 models. Further development would result in the TIE Interceptor series of models. As it stands, the X3 serves as a modest improvement on the base.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_X7,A heavier TIE Advanced model distinguished by its trifecta of radiator wings, a design feature that would see further use on the esteemed TIE/D Defender design. Compared to that later design, the Advanced X7 is both of lighter build and armament, lacking the munitions launchers and ion cannons of the Defender and instead focussing on laser arms. Still makes for a rather capable heavy fighter.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIGELLINUS,Rufaan Tigellinus was one of the original twelve Grand Admirals and later a Grand Moff of the Galactic Empire. Known for his political savvy and charisma as well as being a respected fleet commander, Tigellinus was widely followed in the media and was considered to be a key player in Imperial Court politics.

By the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War he had risen to the rank of General and served in the Invasion of Ylesia With Lowbacca and Jaina Solo.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TITAN_BARGE,This barge contains a superheavy vehicle. The slow speed and weak armor of this transport make it vulnerable to nearly every enemy threat.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TOLSIVRON, Tol Sivron was once part of the Twi'lek Clan Council before serving with Grand Moff Tarkin. Though unimaginative, Sivron was an excellent bureaucrat and manager and ran the secret weapons facility at the Maw Installation.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TOMAX_BREN,Tomax Bren was Captain of the Scimitar assault wing "White Death." Bren would become known for his unorthodox tactics in the Hook Nebula campaign, and  his vast success and adherence to the New Order allowed him to evage court martial. From his military reports Bren would recommend a series of improvements to the TIE Bomber for a proposed Mark 2, inspiring Sienar engineers to design the Scimitar Assault Bomber. Bren's military reports also impressed Grand Admiral Thrawn, who picked Bren as one of his first commanders in the campaign against the New Republic.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TON_RAALK,Proctor of capital city of Giat Nor. Ton Raalk fiercely maintained its edicts, including death for any outsider who dared to enter.

Troubles came to a head when both him and Vanko were kidnapped while meeting to discuss the issue on the cruise liner Kuari Princess, believing the pirates to be in league with the Rebel Alliance.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TORSCH,Babel Torsch proved to be an unusually effective and uncorrupt bureaucrat.

Its design incorporates a large suite of command and control facilities and three outrigger docking arms with 3 large hangars on each arm. The capable Valor is a central command and logistical hub for many military operations.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_VENGEANCE_FRIGATE,The Vengeance-class frigate was an experimental design of the Galactic Empire, with little to no production reported prior to the Battle of Yavin. Its schematics were obtained from the Death Star's ruins and allowed the Vengeance to take on a new life as a favorite of the Zann Consortium, who would mass produce it for their own use and for sale on the black market. The original framework for the Vengeance Frigate had it armed with a pair of mass driver and turbolaser cannons along with conventional shielding, while esoteric variants would strip the shielding for an internal cloaking system.

When Krennel's regime collapsed and both Isards died, Vessery would take his Defender squadrons and vanish from the New Republic's sight. 
TEXT_TOOLTIP_VHORK_GUNSHIP,Named after the deadly bird of prey, the Daruvvian Vhork, the Vhork Gunship is designed to loiter high in the sky to find its targets before raining down fire on the tops of its chosen target.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_VILIM_DISRA,Originally the administrator of the Shelsha sector, Vilim Disra's ambition saw him plotting to overthrow Governor Barshnis Choard. Disra would string Choard along with his support before turning him over to Darth Vader. While the role of governor was denied to him, Disra would rise in other areas over the years, earning the rank of Moff. After Endor, Disra advised Rufaan Tigellinus to reject the Central Committee of Grand Moff's demeaning offer to recruit him. This would lead to Tigellinus' execution and Disra eagerly snatching up his assets and a place on the committee for himself. By 19 ABY, Disra was the leading figure of the Imperial Remnant's Council of Moffs, and formed the Sinister Triumvirate between himself, Grodin Tierce, and the con-artist Flim, lending his political and illicit connections to the conspiracy.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_VIN_NORTHAL,Vin Northal was a former member of the Emperor's Royal Guard and an exemplar of Imperial service. While on customary rotation with a stormtrooper unit, Vin led an assault on a Rebel cell under cover of darkness, but faulty ISB intelligence had, in reality, led them to an orphanage. His soldiers would murder dozens of children in their sleep, an act Vin would be horrified by as it was covered up by Imperial media. Seeing the truth of the Empire, Vin would surrender to the Rebel Alliance requesting asylum, which his former commander, Crix Madine, supported him in. Vin would go on to be one of the Alliance's foremost operatives and SpecForce trainers, and would once save the Alliance council from an Imperial assault singlehandedly.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAA,In order to protect valuable assets of the Corporate Sector Authority, the Picket Fleet designated a portion of their fighters and bombers as garrisons. These garrisons are not only intended to protect the local trade lanes and the planet from pirates but also for cowering the local population into following commands of the local companies.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAB,In order to maximise efficiency and cut as many costs as possible, Corporate Sector Authority Picket Fleet High Command issued a memo to all subsidiary fleet officers. The memo instructed them to utilise Z-95 Headhunters for frontline scouting as they were the cheapest, most numerous, most modular, and most easily replaced model of fighter on the market.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAC,On the occasions the CSA wasn’t subduing low tech civilizations, the Picket Fleet required more advanced strike craft than what they had as standard. These dated, but still viable, fighters would be put to effective use in engagements requiring a heavier touch.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAD,Composed of ship designs produced locally under licence, this small force can engage most frigate or starfighter threats with moderate success or reposition away from more threatening opponents.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAE,Corporate Sector Authority ExOs insisted the Picket Fleet designate teams of rapid response to easily answer any pirate raid or minor provocation, be the threat external, or internal. Unfortunately, not all ships selected for the assignment are particularly fast.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAF,Much to the annoyance of the Empire, Kuat Drive Yards has always been willing to sell its Nebulon-series escorts to any interested buyer with a surprising amount of discretion. That as many of the parties are Imperial-affiliated local forces or Imperial aligned powers is what allows the practice to continue without much hindrance. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAG,Slow but durable strike craft are effective in a variety of roles, especially when subjugating low-tech powers on the fringes of documented space. The common availability means any losses or mishaps are easy to sweep away and replace. The ships are still as capable as ever against any other sort of mismatched opponent, such as a cruiser with insufficient point-defence weaponry.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAH,Eventually the Picket Fleet High Command decided it was more valuable to attempt to repair damaged vessels than to salvage wrecked ones. With support from ExOs, they purchased and refurbished old Galleon class ships to act as fleet tenders and assigned Neutron Star Bulk Cruisers to screen for them in action.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAI,After the conclusion of the Clone Wars there was a plethora of warships surviving in a fully functioning state or easily salvaged and restored to working condition. Despite the new Empire militarising, they desired to use their new designs instead of the ships of the old planetary PDF or the enemy CIS and thus were willing to sell these off to friendly agents such as the CSA in order to fund their expansion. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAJ,To deal with piracy and raiding on the borders of Corporate Sector Authority territory, Picket Fleet High Command deployed groups of this fleet composition. It proved highly efficient as a rapid response tool with the Gladiator able to chase down some of the larger pirate forces, while the Neutron Star provided support against enemy strike-craft and corvettes.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAK,While the Empire focused on producing the larger Imperial class Star Destroyer as their mainline capital ship, the Imperial Navy financed their naval expansion by selling surplus Victory class Star Destroyers to the Corporate Sector Authority, who gleefully made excellent use of them.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAL,Liberators were a favourite battle carrier of the CSA as it combined the ability of long range turbolasers with a large complement of strike craft. Dreadnaughts were also in plentiful supply to the CSA and often used as screening ships for more valuable ships. In this case DHCs were intended to draw the fire of hostile vessels in support of the strike waves launched by the liberators which were sitting in safety
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAM,CSA’s close partnership with the nominally Imperial corporation TaggeCo allowed them easy access to the modular frigate designed by the company. Purchasing them cheaply and utilising them as support in many hostile takeovers and corporate acquisitions.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAN,In lieu of more expensive capital ships, Independent wings of gunships could be used when the range requirements of a mission were too far to reliably send fighters or when sublight speed was not an issue and the expected need for firepower outstripped what fighters could provide. These wings were more than a match for most groups of hostile fighters and ships in the corvette to frigate range. When called upon for fleet battles these wings would often be used to spearhead and bolster the initial fighter engagement where their bulk would allow them survive the many hits that initial pass causes for both sides.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAO,The vessels of corporations that drew the ire of the Empire after the Clone Wars were often seized and then sold off to the Corporate Sector Authority. This move came at the benefit of both factions as the Empire used the proceeds of the sale to fund their military growth while the CSA used these older vessels to subdue more planets increasing the profits of the sector and thus increasing their tithe to the Empire. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAP,In order to compete with more advanced starfighters, The CSA turned to these heavy fighters that could blast down significant numbers of modern lighter fighters while taking few losses in return. Heavy bombers can follow in their wake to cripple larger targets.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAQ,Carriers formed a mainstay of CSA combat task groups as they provided the capability of bringing large numbers of cheap and relatively expendable strike craft into a battle zone which would be sent at the enemy while the carriers often stayed at long range where it was safe. While this often resulted in large losses of pilots and strike craft, these were both in large supply inside the CSA and thus it was seen as a cost effective exchange to the board members. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAR,For the occasions when the Picket Fleet required significant firepower to dislodge major threats, or stubborn resistance, this fleet composition proved highly effective. The only drawbacks were how little salvage was left in the aftermath and the logistical train needed to restock all the missiles which had been fired off to saturate the target. Initial uses against planetary targets was deemed non optimal due to the inability to recover assets after the bombardment. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAS,Supported by old CIS warship designs with similar combat ranges, the Bulwark Mk III is often tasked with taking out any large combat vessel in a barrage of heavy turbolaser and heavy ion cannon. Recusants provide long range fire and anti fighter screening in case any hostile strike craft make it through the fighter screens. Bulwark MK I while smaller than the MK III are available in larger numbers and are armed with the same weapons thus help to contribute to mass of laser and ion fire reaching out to devastate a single large threat. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAT,These highly expensive and powerful taskforces spend the vast majority of their time in port to reduce the costs. However there are instances where tensions escalate enough that the CSA feels the necessity to demonstrate their true military potential to enemies. It is hoped by the Board that just the sheer presence of these warships suddenly appearing in a theatre will cause the enemy to back down out of sheer fear at the concentrated firepower. In cases where battle is enjoined anyways this task force template often takes centre stage of the CSA fleets. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CSA_AAU,The IRD is a design entrusted to serve in many roles within the Picket Fleet of the Corporate Sector Authority. This means it is common for small detachments of several squadrons dispatched on short range patrols of CSA controlled space to ensure that there is no pirate activity and attempt to catch smugglers. When there is a sudden outbreak of hostilities with a peer opponent, these groups of small fighters are tasked with harassing any enemy incursion in order to buy time for larger CSA space assets to respond. Enemy bombers are often given a high priority for these squadrons to engage as the engagement escalates.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAA,The Imperial forces left fighter garrisons on every single base and planet they possess. The TIE Fighter would be the mass of Imperial garrisons while the newer TIE Interceptors would bolster fighter groups where a threat was expected. TIE Bombers would suppress any ground threat or attack any capital ship approaching the area.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAB,TIE fighters that were too damaged or had too much stress on the frame were often reconditioned and then sent to training schools to teach new pilots how to fly. Also these fighters would often end up as the garrison forces on backwater planets which the Imperial command did not care about but still had to place fighters on. Despite not being considered combat worthy, if the war brings conflict to their local area then these light fighters will still need to defend Imperial Space. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAC,Raider II Corvettes were armed for anti ship combat and could be highly deadly when in large mass with concentrated turbolaser and ion cannon fire. However these small ships were relatively fragile when their target lived long enough to return fire. Thus it was a common tactic to base their wolf pack around larger frigates which could withstand enemy return fire. For the EA the ever reliable and versatile Arquitens would be the cornerstone for lots of these wolfpacks. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAD,The high speed but short range A9 interceptor could react rapidly to any fighter incursions into the nearby space if given enough warning. However the fighter lacked firepower and could find itself outmatched against high quality fighters or if the enemy had numerical superiority. Adz corvettes could base these short range fighters on long patrols while also providing a safe haven with their mass of rapid firing laser cannons and ions if the fighters find themselves outmatched in a dogfight. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAE,Both long range small ships the Gamma ATR-6 and the IPV would often be deployed on the same missions for anti piracy or system patrols. The faster IPV would range out to detect any threat. When such a threat was located, the IPV would work to reduce any fighter protection the target possessed while guiding the slower Gamma ATR-6 Squadrons to make attack runs at the designated target. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAF,Beset by constant war with frequent border raids from the New Republic, The Eriadu Authority had to maintain constant patrols of their territory to detect and intercept these raids before they struck. The Eidolon strike presented a self-contained group of fighter craft which could respond to NR fighters while the Strike Cruiser itself possessed enough firepower to rapidly finish off NR corvettes and frigates that often supported these raids. In periods of high activity the Eidolon could be supported with additional fighters such as the TIE Sentinel which could protect the Strike cruiser from retaliation while its strike group is out or reinforce the strike group itself.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAG,Both designs were often used for long-duration patrol and assault missions, the contradictory weapon loadouts and combat characteristics of the block-1 Imperial and Gladiator series frigates work well together. Each provides different firepower and support while being relatively fast vessels, allowing them to engage near any target type when covering the other’s weakness.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAH,Facing large scale attrition of pilots and fighters against superior New Republic Fighters, Ace pilot Shea Hublin lobbied the EA to add shield generators to their TIE fighters arguing that the added survivability would be worth the additional cost and decrease in performance. In dire straits over the constant drain in fighter resources, this was accepted and field trials were started with squadrons converted over to the new shielded variants of their fighters.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAI,An autonomous independent commando formation which did not align themselves to any single warlord post Endor. Instead they remained loyal to their original mission of hunting down the Rebellion wherever they could with covert operations. Despite no loyalty to a warlord, they were willing to assist them if their interests align.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAJ,A task group formed in the waning period of the Clone Wars, Gladiator Star Destroyers escorted Victory Star Destroyers to their target. At long ranges the Gladiator could add its munitions to the barrage unleashed by the VSD. At shorter ranges the Gladiator could protect the VSD from small vessels or fighters trying to swarm it while using the VSD as protection against larger vessels.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAK,While the IPV-1 was often used in system patrol and anti fighter picket duty, by the period of the Galactic Civil War it was starting to age and struggle against the newest and best fighters. The Eriadu Authority was thus forced to seek out newer corvettes to help protect their territory from New Republic fighters. However they could never secure a sufficient supply of newer model IPV/4s which forced the usage of the older IPV-1s alongside to make up numbers.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAL,With anti fighter corvettes in ceaseless use operating against the New Republic Fighters, the Gamma ATR lost their corvette escort in favour of older Skipray models which still provided an anti fighter screen to clear the path to a target for the Gamma ATRs. The Skiprays could also join in the assault on the target with their own proton torpedoes if additional firepower is required or hostile fighters are not a threat.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAM,With incessant attacks on Eriadu space, all EA logistical convoys demanded heavy escorts. Preybirds were long range heavy fighters which could support a convoy of Galleons and blunt any fighter attack. Imperial-I Frigates possessed the capability to match any threat bar ships far larger than it, making the Imperial-I a versatile escort frigate. Such a heavy and capable escort gave a decent chance for the Galleon to make it to its destination and deliver the much needed supplies. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAN,The TIE Heavy Bomber carried even more ordinance than the powerful TIE Bomber but still maintained its relative fragility. In order to make the valuable bombers get to their target they were provided with heavy escorts. TIE Fighters would range out to intercept enemy fighters at range while the turreted TIE Sentinels maintain position around the bombers to clean up fighters that made it past the screen and were attempting attack runs on the bombers. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAO,Both models of the Imperial Star Destroyer were the iconic and ever present Imperial capital ship. These extremely powerful and well rounded capital ships were able to fight off or destroy any peer or lesser opponent with their arrays of turbolasers and large Hangar groups. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAP,Despite being far slower than the ISD I, the VSD I still represented a significant concentration of firepower in their turbolasers and missiles. Thus some commanders decided the reduction of speed for the formation was a worthwhile trade off for the additional combat power. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAQ,The ISD II was a powerful warship able to go head to head with most other capital ships and win convincingly which, alongside its high speed, made it a terrifying foe. Gladiator Star Destroyers and Arquitens could keep pace and provide support for the large warship in swatting away smaller vessels and fighters and thus clearing a path to the ISD’s target. After the other threats were dealt with these smaller ships could also turn their weapons to join in the capital ship engagements to speed up their victory.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAR,Essentially an upsized Tector Star Destroyer, the Allegiance Battlecruiser was an extremely deadly warship which could dominate any capital ship. Such a large warship could make an excellent centre point for a formation of Imperial star destroyers. All but the largest and well protected warships are rapidly torn apart by the focused firepower while swarms of TIE fighters circle the formation to intercept any fighter attack.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAS,A Torpedo Sphere alone is about to output massive amounts of ordinance on a single target at long ranges. When flanked by two Victory Star Destroyers, the amount of missiles and torpedoes that fill the void is truly terrifying and devastating to be one the receiving end of. Eidolon Strike Cruisers maintain stations around the formation in order to fend off smaller ships attempting to interfere with large ships and provide some fighter cover. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAT,The Praetor is a massive warship that is able to fight fleets by itself. It only becomes more capable when backed by the potent ISD I and the Imperial-I Frigate. Both vessels are capable of launching large amounts of fighters to provide a screen for the formation while also possessing a wide range of calibres of turbolasers to target a wide range of enemies.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAU,The Large Tagge Battlecruiser could often be seen serving alongside any faction which the House of Tagge decided to support at the time. Overstretched by the constant fighting the Eriadu Authority have found themselves in, they could only afford to detach a small task force of corvettes from their fleets to provide a screen for the large battlecruiser.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EA_AAV,A standard Imperial formation for the Empire involved a pair of Torpedo Spheres synchronising their fire against a single planetary target to rapidly overwhelm the local shields and destroy the target on the ground. This formation could also be used in space battles where the Torpedo Spheres combine their fire onto a single target to devastate it with a nonstop barrage of proton munitions. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAA,The Nssis Clawcraft was the mainline fighter for the Empire of the Hand in the Unknown Regions. A hybridisation of Chiss tech with TIE design philosophy which gives it far more protection and more upfront firepower than the TIE Fighters. Flights of Nssis tend to be reinforced by a squadron of Krssis Interceptors, which are more lightly armed and armored but significantly faster and no less maneuverable. The Krssis chase down any fighter trying to run away from the fight or focus on important targets while the Nssis tie down any escorts. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAB,Syca Bombers was the premier bomber of the Empire of Hand which mixes protection and speed although lacking in payload compared to the Imperial bombers. Furions escorted the Syca but could lag behind the fast bomber if the squadrons failed to coordinate. It was a common tactic to let the Furions go ahead and engage the enemy fighters with their heavy fighter before the Sycas started their attack runs. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAC,These small fast corvettes were often found roaming EOTH space or battlegroups to detect and defeat small scale incursions. The Syzygos specialised in shooting down fighters while the pack of Kuuros barraged larger targets with turbolasers and assault concussion missiles. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAD,Fruoros were a tried and tested Chiss frigate design which was fast and nimble alongside good firepower for its size. On long range missions they were often supported by the Ormos which carried some heavier weapons along with a complement of fighters to protect against any strike craft. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAE,The Empire of the Hand used old Republic surplus fighters, funnelled to them by the Emperor before his death, to scout ahead and patrol borders in a variety of theatres and to rapidly respond to threats on the fringes of their control to tie down the enemy while reinforcements arrived.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAF,The Rohkea was a design offered to the Empire of the Hand by one of their many client races. Combining medium calibre turbolasers and a large array of proton torpedo launchers, the design was a deadly warship which could rapidly wear down hostile vessels under its barrage. Groups of Fruoros either protected the Rohkea from smaller vessels or added their weight of fire to the unfortunate target of the Rohkea.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAG,Inspired by the Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser shown to them by the Empire, the Kynigos takes on the same multirole missions as its ancestor design. Although it lacked Hangar space and thus was often supported by the Ormos Carrier to ensure there was sufficient fighter coverage. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAH,A client race design focused on fleet support, the Baomu was dedicated to repairing damage sustained by the EOTH vessels and making sure their stocks of supplies were kept topped up. Muqaraea corvettes often escorted these support ships to protect them from surprise fighter raids. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAI,Thrawn’s Missile Boat design was highly effective in the Empire, so it stands to reason he would share the design with the puppet state he had been building in the Unknown Region. Paired with the Scarssis Interceptors to tie down enemy strike craft, Missile Boats would have a clear run at enemy ships.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAJ,The Chaf’s focus on direct firepower could directly address the Ascendency Star Destroyer, while the Ascendancy could provide a screen of fighter protection for the Chaf, balancing out their respective roles effectively.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAK,The Ascendency Star Destroyer was a powerful multi-role carrier utilised by the Empire of the Hand, somewhat similar in doctrine to the old Venator. The Hand’s High Command paired some Ascendancy ships with the more compact and weaker Ormos carriers to provide fighter support in their fleets.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAL,Both the Chaf and Kynigos were Chiss inspired takes on the Victory Star Destroyer and the Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser respectively and operated in a similar manner to their forebears. Chafs focused heavy megamaser and assault concussion missile fire on their targets while the Kynigos provided support.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAM,The Empire of the Hand utilised some material provided by the Galactic Empire to support their activities in the Unknown Regions. These ships proved as effective there as they did elsewhere in the galaxy.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAN,The large Efodio contained large amounts of supplies in its cavernous holds which made it the centre point for all ships in the local area when away from EotH stations and planets. From this ship many task forces and battlegroups started their operations or took needed pauses to restore themselves. Groups of Fruoros maintained station at all times to ensure the Tender’s safety. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAO,The Syndic and Phalanx both had advanced sublight engines capable of rapidly deploying and redeploying as battle lines shifted against enemy forces to keep pressure up on the enemy until they broke.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAP,The Empire of the Hand needed a battlegroup they could deploy against more powerful threats. The Phalanx provided an anchor for the longer range Peltast and Rohkea to bombard enemy hard targets once the Phalanx overloaded enemy shields.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_EOTH_AAQ,The Intego Destroyer proved to be an effective capital ship, sacrificing some of the Phalanx’s firepower for a boost in shielding and armour, it could last a significantly longer amount of time in sustained combat, making it ideal to draw enemy fire while paired with smaller, more fragile damage dealers, such as the Chaf and Syndic.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAA,Lacking the same access to modern TIE lines as the Imperial Remnant the Greater Maldrood has to rely on older models of TIEs such as the TIE/gt to supplement the ever present TIE Fighter instead of the TIE Bomber. Similarly the 'Ugly' Clutch is used instead of the TIE Interceptor as an elite fighter squadron to reinforce the group, although many Imperials would be repulsed at the claim that an ugly fighter designed by pirates could be better in any way than Imperial equipment. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAB,Produced in mass during the Clone Wars before eventually being retired in favour of the TIE line of fighters. Somewhere scrapped or sold off to other groups in the galaxy but also a lot were mothballed in extensive storage facilities. Such stockpiles of gear were broken into and reactivated by many different groups including Imperial Warlords who were short on fighters. The Greater Maldrood, cut off from the best shipyards but yet prone to high attrition tactics always had a need for fighters even if they were considered outdated. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAC,Limited in numbers and more expensive than the average Imperial Fighter, TIE Interceptors were only used by the Greater Maldrood in the most important tasks such as escorting the high speed TIE Oppressors on bombing runs against high value targets. Although the TIE Oppressor packs far less firepower than the normal TIE Bomber it has far more survivability both in anti-fighter capability and resilience, both of which are reflected in the production cost.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAD,The Imperials preferred to equip their Carracks to combat large ships with heavy turbolasers and ion cannons which allowed them to be highly lethal to ships far larger than it. However they often were found to struggle against small ships and fighters which resulted in the GM deciding to escort them with Vigils. The Vigil was a small cheap compact design often used as a patrol vessel but found another use in swarming hostile frigates with their lighter turbolasers.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAE,Composed of small ships dedicated on killing fighters and bombers, this taskforce could be found sweeping GM space or as pickets for GM fleets in order to protect them from hostile strike craft. Guardian gunships are the only ship in the task force which possesses any real combat ability against larger ships but are really only viably able to hit corvettes or small frigates unless focused in much greater numbers. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAF,An autonomous independent commando formation which did not align themselves to any single warlord post Endor. Instead they remained loyal to their original mission of hunting down the Rebellion wherever they could with covert operations. Despite no loyalty to a warlord, they were willing to assist them if their interests align.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAG,Despite the KDY Eidolon Strike Cruiser being an upgrade to the original Loronar design in many ways, it was only produced in small numbers due to the original design having a versatility and modularity which was lost by the KDY upgrade. Due to its small numbers the Eidolon was forced into bit part roles such as flagships for officials or occasionally as leader vessel and reinforcement for groups of Loronar Strike Cruisers.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAH,Groups of well armed and fast cruisers were the mainstay of the GM navy. Vindicators were capable of dealing with multiple different threats while providing anti fighter cover for Acclamator IIs. These were the bane of all frigates and light cruisers with hailstorms of light turbolaser fire alongside high speed which allowed them to overhaul their targets. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAI,Star Galleons were logistical vessels which were produced en masse and had the potential to fend off small raids with their own armaments. However they were still vulnerable to any dedicated attack and thus required escorts whenever they were going into zones which were thought to be dangerous. Pursuits often performed the task of small escorts for missions like this.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAJ,The Imperial II Frigate was a versatile frigate in the service of the Greater Maldrood with a range of weapons allowing it to take on all threats of the same size and smaller. It also had a generous Hangar capacity which could be used to transport fighters and bombers into a combat zone. This was needed due to the short range and lack of independence of the normal Imperial strike craft. When combat was expected and there was time to pick up more supplies extra bombers could be packed into the Hangar ready to launch as soon as the Frigate arrived at the combat zone. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAK,Made from a rarer alloy than the normal Victory II Star Destroyer, The Crimson Command Victory Star Destroyer is a very distinctive red and was part of a limited production run from before the Battle of Endor. The Maldrood brothers would use these ships in massive deployments as a sledgehammer due to the sheer concentration of turbolaser and ion cannon fire. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAL,Some targets are not worth sacrificing assets in taking and are too immobile to protect themselves from long range fire. When this occurs, valuable Broadside Cruisers are requested to barrage the target with proton torpedoes while escorting pursuits provide support fire with their heavy turbolasers. Strike Cruisers of the Gorath variant remain on station to provide security and fighter cover while the barrage takes place and then close on the target to finish what survived the barrage. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAM,Despite being older and less favoured the Victory Star Destroyer still provided valuable capabilities to the Greater Maldrood Fleet due the mass of missiles it was able to fire on target in a short amount of time. However unlike the Broadsides the VSDs were capable of defeating ships of the same size class and smaller and thus did not need to be as cautious about their deployment and positioning in battle. Tartans typically would protect the VSDs from fighters and bombers which remained one of the few weaknesses of the VSD. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAN,The TIE Avenger was a highly capable Imperial starfighter although this quality did limit the amount of them available to be deployed at one time due to the cost and complexity of production, a fact made worse by their high demand. In order to boost their survivability in battle,Skiprays could be deployed alongside the TIEs in order to provide a larger more durable target for enemy fighters. Thus it was hoped that TIE Avenger losses in battle would be reduced.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAO,The Greater Maldrood lack of large infrastructure often forced the Warlord brothers to rely on smaller and cheaper warships. However this lack was not absolute with the Brothers still capable of bringing new Imperial Star Destroyers online which were then kept in reserve in order to resolve more intense areas of the front when the swarm of smaller vessels failed. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAP,The Noble House of Tagge was an influential noble family which possessed its own war fleet which included several of their own designs. These included the large Tagge Battlecruisers which could be rarely seen deployed alongside the Imperial groups allied to the House of Tagge, although only when the Tagge nobility thought they stood to benefit.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GM_AAQ,Altors are massive logistical vessels focused solely on moving supplies around and delivering them to several vessels at once. While normally kept in safe locations, the turmoil of war can often force these vessels to operate near or on the front line. Altors are always hives of activity as ships arrive and leave constantly while a picket maintains a constant vigil. The closer to the Front this group gets, the greater the tempo of ships and the stronger the picket gets until the Altor, the ships it is servicing, and its picket combined can be its own massive war fleet. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAA,The Espos of the CSA are a combination of local police force and local defence security force under the Security Division. In both roles the Espos have proven themselves to be perfectly willing to use excessive violence against whoever provokes their ire. Droidekas can be assigned to assist Espos on their deployments whenever additional protection and firepower is needed. Often Droidekas are tasked to form a frontline where their shield bubbles can protect the Espo troopers from any return fire, while the Espos fire over the heads of the Droidekas into the enemy or crowd of rioters. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAB,With the nationalisation of the Trade Federation, the numerous battle droids the company had produced even prior to the Clone Wars were originally going to be scrapped by the new Empire. The Corporate Sector Authority didn’t particularly care about the symbolism of that tumultuous time and saw an opportunity to purchase the hardware very cheaply, saving the Empire time and resources in exchange for cheap, but effective security forces.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAC,The CSA often needed heavy suppression units to control volatile new acquisitions and pacify recently obtained labour forces. To that end the Security Division deployed heavy infantry squads to clear away any enemy speeders or occasionally tanks, while the rapid blasters on the walkers would quickly dissuade any crowds or militia from attempting to get in the way of their profit margin.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAD,The GX12 was designed purely to move infantry into battle quickly and safely to the point it was known as a portable bunker to civilians. Its grenades and lasers made it proficient at engaging any hostile infantry and providing covering fire for any infantry embarking or disembarking from the van. Espo soldiers in heavier armour and better weapons provide a backbone of capable assault troopers for regular Espos in the rapid reaction force. Attached medics keep Espo losses to a minimum, saving money on retraining replacements.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAE,X10 Groundcruisers tended to be small enough to fit on most roads and pathways of varying levels of development, while destroyer droids accompanied them. Generally used to patrol pacified cities or enforcing curfews, these units were also quick enough to respond to larger incursions rapidly enough to silence any dissidents before a serious riot could form.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAF,The Corporate Sector as it is now was formed in the aftermath of the Clone Wars, and acquired through various means lots of battle droids from the era. To these the CSA would add in their own droid designs such as the Class 1 Defence Droid. These droids could be used by the CSA in battle to prevent the loss of lives of their own forces while acting as a strong multipurpose threat against all targets on the ground. Old B1s would make up the mass of the supporting formations while Droidekas would provide additional mobility and anti-infantry firepower. These battle droids aptly assisted the CSA in the expansion against less advanced societies near CSA space. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAG,On occasion the CSA’s tight control of local populations could slip. In such situations, significant force would be required to bring everything back under control. To that end, JX40s could bring in several infantry squads, and ferry away any prisoners while walkers helped to pacify any dangerous agitators. Such units also proved highly effective in liquidation operations, performing hostile takeovers of new assets at the discretion of CSA Zone Directors.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAH,GX12 Hovervans transport squads of Espos into battle and then support them in the fighting when needed by the CSA. When the opposition is expected to have vehicle threats then the Espos can be assisted by attached Class 1 Defence Droids with their anti-vehicle lasers. JX40s can be called upon for fire support with their numerous grenade launchers; along with providing the capability for the Espos to bring any captives back with them. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAI,Some operations required additional support from the air. SX20 Airskimmers could help to suppress rioting crowds with strafing runs, or spot enemy opposition from the air. Accompanying them, X10 Groundcruisers could pursue spotted enemies or secure the area from any additional rioters once the Airskimmers moved on.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAJ,For situations where firepower is required, K22 Aero-Interceptors prove to be highly effective anti-vehicle air speeders, while the SX20 could suppress enemy soft targets. These units were generally deployed against more well developed acquisitions or enemy forces.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAK,Both the Hailfire and Persuader Tank are designs inherited by the CSA from the defeated corporations dissolved with the end of the Clone Wars. However, in a disturbing parallel, they often were used in a similar manner by the CSA as those companies which made the vehicles in suppressing any form of protest against the policies of the CSA, with crushing speed and violence. On occasion they might also be deployed in a major ground battle when the territory of the CSA was threatened by an outside power. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAL,The Strikebreaker was one of the most formidable ground vehicles the CSA had in its normal arsenal and it was packed with lasers and grenades for anti-vehicle and anti-infantry work. It also had the capability of carrying a platoon of infantry inside each vehicle. Thus their deployment by the CSA often signalled they were serious about maintaining their presence on the planet no matter the cost in collateral damage. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAM,Some riots or defensive positions are simply too dangerous to deploy directly into. When those situations arise, the CSA deploys artillery units inherited from the former Corporate Alliance. This artillery piece could provide saturated bombardment into dangerous riots or well defended positions in anticipation of future Espo deployment. For protection of the vulnerable and valuable asset, a squad of B1 droids are assigned as security and protection.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAN,Against significant enemy force, or very highly developed planets, the CSA required armoured tanks and rapid heavy speeders to break initial enemy defences before Espo units could safely be deployed for cleanup and more thorough asset acquisition. To that end, Persuader droid tanks backed up by the heavy Strikebreaker hover vehicles could punch through most enemy lines, especially when supported from the air by K22 Aero-Interceptor airspeeders.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAO,The Resources Division of the Corporate Sector often chooses to acquire a new planetary asset, whether for the labour force, existing infrastructure, or mineral rights. When such a choice has been made, the Security Division deploys this force to establish a beachhead and forward command post to launch a full invasion. The Strikebreakers and Espos could establish control over an area, and the B1s could begin patrolling in anticipation of more forces arriving. GX12s could help rapidly redeploy across a battlefield or provide fire support to pacify all local resistance, professional or otherwise.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_CSA_AAP,A wartime formation of the CSA which deployed a platoon of Espo soldiers as their front line. A platoon of Heavy Espos often kept in reserve to act as an assault force whenever a weakness in the enemy line was detected, or as a rapid reaction formation for weakness in their own lines. Class 1 Defence Droids would be scattered along the line to bolster the firepower of the regular Espo soldiers. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAA,A standard platoon of Imperial Army troopers within the Eriadu Authority composed of two synergistic elements. Some squads are equipped with repeater slugthrowers and rapid firing carbines to suppress any infantry while other squads take advantage of this base of fire to finish off the enemy with their grenade launchers. These platoons of Army Troopers are found across the breadth of the Eriadu Authority’s domain as garrison forces or serving as line soldiers for the army. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAB,A small detachment of Imperial Army troopers armed with rifles and heavy weaponry. These small detachments rely heavily on their firepower to compensate for a lack of numbers and are commonly used to augment other formations with additional infantry or to garrison low priority sectors. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAC,Due to the self-declared Superior General Delvardus' military preferences, Eriadu forces can be slow and lumbering. Therefore it is paramount for the commanders to know exactly where their enemy was located before they could unleash their armoured columns. For this reason, small recon groups were sent out to thoroughly reconnoitre the assigned areas using 64-Y Sled Speeders. Army Guards are sent along to set up and defend forward base camps for the scouts. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAD,While normally sent out on independent missions away from the regular forces, Army Special Missions forces were sometimes required by circumstance to assist regular forces in combat. In small numbers these elite and veteran troopers would form small flexible formations, which would attach themselves to a larger formation to bolster their morale and use their experience to solve problems which would block the regulars. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAE,Army Guards which have been tasked with defending the bases of the Eriadu Authority's Army can also be deployed into the field to protect important locations such as command posts or trauma stations. In the latter the Army Guard can also send squads forward with medical teams to keep the medics safe as they work to stabilise and treat any casualties.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAF,Taking inspiration from High Colonel Johans playbook, 1-L Imperial Repulsortanks form the core of the Eriadu Authority’s light armour arsenal, and frequently used as a screening force for other heavier formations. These fast light vehicles are deadly towards infantry and some light vehicles, while also being mobile enough to evade most things which would be a serious threat to them. Paired with this are the military walkers favored by commanders like General Veers; All Terrain Missile Platforms plod in the wake of the 1-L IRTs, ready to saturate any serious threat to the repulsor tanks or large concentrations of troops with a deadly swarm of concussion missiles.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAG,The strange looking AT-MP was a mobile missile platform in common usage in walker complements in territories the Eriadu Authority encompassed. Commonly tasked with engaging large concentrations of infantry and light vehicles with a barrage of concussion missiles, the sheer volume of their firepower would shock New Republic infantry especially. Imperial Army Guard Squads were sometimes ordered forward as a follow-on assault from a barrage of AT-MPs to mop up any survivors with their heavy weapons. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAH,The 64-Y Sled Speeders are an extremely swift speeder bike which is able to search a massive amount of terrain due to their speed. However they are extremely exposed in combat due to their relative lack of firepower and protection; for this reason the Eriadu Authority's commanders sometimes task 1-L Imperial Repulsor tanks to cooperate with the speeders to provide some firepower and protection whenever the speeders find themselves in danger. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAI,The Imperial Security Bureau maintains its own military formations through the Enforcement branch, which can be used to help eliminate any threat to the state. While they often operate autonomously, they can cooperate with or even conscript other Imperial forces to assist with their missions. Taking over small groups of elite forces such as the Imperial Army Commandos to use as assault troops is beneficial for the ISB as it allows them to achieve their objectives while minimizing ISB casualties. ISB Infiltrator Sniper Teams provide overwatch cover to the Army Commando teams from a safe distance while also ensuring the commandos remain loyal to the mission. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAJ,The Imperial Security Bureau maintains its own military formations through the Enforcement branch, which can be used to help eliminate any threat to the state. While they often operate autonomously, they can cooperate with or even conscript other Imperial forces to assist with their missions. Sometimes elite forces are not available for the ISB operatives to commandeer and thus are forced to make do with regular line troops to make the mass of a needed assault. ISB Stormtroopers could imitate regular Stormtroopers and lead the assault of the Army Troopers, while watching out for any sight of disloyalty within the ranks. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAK,Both the Imperial Security Bureau and the Army Special Missions Forces are concerned with dealing in Rebel activity inside the Empire, and thus could sometimes cooperate to hit an important target to varying degrees of warmth from both parties. While the Army Special Missions forces make up the bulk of the of the assault forces, ISB Infiltrator Assault teams could be attached to an Army Special Missions to bolster their capabilities and ensure the interests of the Security Bureau are carried out. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAL,A pair of 1-L Imperial Repulsortanks are strong foe to light vehicle and infantry, but their weapons were found to be lacking against medium or heavy vehicles. Taking inspiration from High Colonel Zel Johans, Army Commanders decided that it was preferable to attach 1-M Imperial Repulsortanks to squads of 1-L IRTs in order to provide the firepower needed to competently deal with enemy vehicles, rather than having the lighter tanks being forced to retreat whenever those foes were encountered. This however did have the down side of dispersing the 1-Ms across defensive lines, which could prevent them being concentrated against a strong vehicle based attack. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAM,The Lancet was developed by the Empire to provide air mobile artillery, which thus was able to react to developing situations far faster than ground based equipment, in addition to being able to be deployed to a greater range of conditions. 64-Y Sled Speeders are used by scouts trained in air-ground coordination for the purpose of locating targets and calling in strikes from the Lancets. These Sled Speeders offer the speed needed for these scouts to maintain position with the Lancets in a rapidly developing battle situation.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAN,The AT-AA is the standard vehicle deployed by the Empire and its splinter warlords in order to deal with air vehicles or starfighters operating in the atmosphere. It is relatively slow and vulnerable to any ground based threats however, and thus needs to be guarded. Under advisement from General Veers after he found himself tied to Eriadu's forces, Eriadu's armies use Imperial Army Guards for this task due to their increased heavy firepower. This allows them to hold out against any attack for longer which increases the chance the valuable anti-air walkers could be saved, and freed up regular line troopers to remain on the frontline. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAO,Pushed heavily by General Octavion Sorin in contempt of General Veer's walker preference, the Heavy Repulsortank Company is the largest concentration of mobile armour collected by the Eriadu Authority. 1-H IRTs are the centre point of the formation with their large bulk allowing them to absorb enemy fire far better than their smaller repulsortanks. They also possess the firepower to deal with any enemy vehicle the formation encounters. 1-L IRTs screen the formation and deal with any infantry concentrations in their path, and 1-M IRTs act as a flexible reserve to react to any developing situation. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAP,The large weapon filled flying wing that is the Flashblind are capable of dominating the skies above a terrestrial battlefield, with a single one capable spelling doom for vehicle and infantry alike. Large concentrations of Flashblind airspeeders are capable of devastating enemy formations ahead of a ground assault allowing ground troops to easily assault the disrupted enemy. Lancet Aerial Artillery flyers can also be attached to the air wing to provide the ability to deal with enemy anti-air vehicles at a safe range rather than having to risk the Flashblinds in a direct duel with the ground vehicles. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAQ,The Eriadu Authority's officer such as Octavion Sorin made use of a hover vehicle for their artillery platform, which uses the normal Imperial artillery cannon to deliver firepower at long ranges. Given that its range far exceeds the platforms own sensor capabilities, it is common for the Eriadu Authority's commanders to partner each Medium Mobile Artillery Hovertank with several 64-Y Sled Speeders. These act as long range reconnaissance to enable artillery fire to be called in on target as soon as any enemy ventures into range. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAR,The famous Imperial AT-AT is the main assault walker of the Eriadu Authority and a favorite of Superior General Delvardus since his acquisition of a stockpile of them. These massive four legged walkers are an indomitable force head on, but are extremely exposed to flanking attacks or infantry getting in close. For this reason it is common practice for commanders to designate escort vehicles such as the AT-MP to screen these threats away from the AT-ATs. History has also proven the ability of airspeeders to pose a threat to the lumbering beasts, and thus AT-AA walkers can be included in the escort group of the AT-ATs to keep the skies clear of threats. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAS,The large Tracked Mobile Base has been adopted across the Eriadu Authority as a mobile command centre, which enables commanders to keep their command posts close to the front. Given that the task of being a command centre means they are handling a large amount of real time data about the current battlefield, these vehicles also make for an amazing artillery coordination post. Thus Eriadu Army commanders often bring several artillery pieces along with their bases to give the commander the ability to instantly influence events on the battlefield without having to wait for the movement of troops or the ability of their subordinates. Knowing that these vehicles are valuable targets for any enemy air strikes, it is also common for an AT-AA to provide escort to the small command group. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAT,The Special Missions Company was a formation designated by the Imperial Army’s Order of Battle as designed during the Empire. Despite the disruption caused by the collapse of the Empire in the wake of Palpatine’s death, the Eriadu Authority has maintained the ability to create and deploy these standard formations of special forces. 64-Y Sled Speeders of the Augmented Scout Platoon ensure that the company has a large capability for reconnaissance to locate weak points for the three Army Special Platoons to assault. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAU,When the Army Special Missions Company was expecting to face heavy resistance, then the standard order of battle authorised a lot of other assets to be subordinated and attached to the company to ensure it is capable of achieving its mission. Regular Army troopers provide mass to any infantry assault while artillery platforms provide long range deadly fire. The 1-L and 1-M Imperial Repulsortanks are able to rapidly respond to any threats being posed to the Company and deal with any vehicle based threats that are encountered.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EOTH_AAA,An Empire of the Hand infantry platoon is larger than normal but has a further subdivision where two squads are paired up together. This arrangement allows an EOTH infantry platoon to have more combat endurance than traditional platoons of the galaxy with its size while still maintaining good tactical mobility with its paired squads. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EOTH_AAB,The Empire of the Hand is not a large galactic power, yet they face many enemies in the Unknown Regions. They do not have access to the massive pools of manpower of other factions and thus they need to be extremely careful about the lives of their soldiers. Thus the Hand makes heavy use of medical teams in an attempt to preserve the lives of wounded troops. It was common practice to send a pair of squads to escort the medical teams when they ventured into the combat area.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EOTH_AAC,When Empire of the Hand forces encounter enemy infantry which are heavily entrenched, they prefer to assault the position with specialised armoured vehicles instead of using infantry. Two troops of Rapid Fire Tanks take up positions to create a base of fire on the entrenched enemy. Under the cover of this suppressive fire the Flame Tanks charge into range and then drown the enemy in flames.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EOTH_AAD,When extensive infantry opposition is expected, or Grand Admiral Thrawn was especially aggravated, the Empire of the Hand authorised their local commanders to attach troops of Flame Tanks to their platoons of House Phalanx soldiers. It is expected that the Phalanx troopers will find and then suppress any hostiles which creates opportunities for the Flame Tanks to rapidly close and destroy the enemy. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EOTH_AAE,Kirovs are the main anti-air vehicle used by the Empire of the Hand. These small vehicles are often deployed in mass in order to compensate for their fragility as it is feared any air threat would be able to destroy an isolated Kirov. A singular Flame Tank is assigned to the Squadron to act as protection and would be expected to sacrifice itself if needed in order to buy time for the Kirovs to escape. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EOTH_AAF,A Medium Armour Squadron of the Empire of the Hand is composed of two troops of different models of vehicles. The troop of Rapid Fire Tanks are specialised for anti-infantry engagements, and thus act as a screen for the Gilzeans Tanks in addition to being a reconnaissance element to the squadron. The second troop of the Squadron is composed of Gilzeans Tanks which is specialised against other vehicles. For this reason the Gilzeans are kept in reserve of the Squadron until hostile vehicles have been detected and then are brought forward to engage them while the Rapid Fire Tanks are withdrawn behind their protection. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EOTH_AAG,The House Air Combat Wing is standardised around six AirStraeker airspeeders subdivided into three pairs. Their speed allows them to easily set up favourable attack runs while their strong blaster cannon is highly capable at destroying vehicles. Because of these reasons, AirStraekers are commonly deployed to hunt down any enemy vehicles in the combat area although it can be a waste of their time to strafe infantry. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EOTH_AAH,The Plasma Mortar is the standard artillery piece of the Empire of the Hand military. While it is a highly capable artillery piece, it is completely incapable of defending itself against infantry or vehicles. For this reason, it is common practice for Hand ground commanders to assign Kirovs to batteries of these mortars to provide air protection in addition to two pairs of squads of Phalanx troopers as ground protection. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EOTH_AAI,The Heavy Armour Squadron of the Empire of the Hand is commonly composed of an enlarged troop of Gilzean tanks and a singular Megamaser Tank. The MMT uses its giant turreted gun to destroy or heavily damage any vehicle or fortification in a single blast. The Gilzeans are tasked to herd any enemy into the firing arcs of their partner MMT. Any vehicle which is not outright destroyed by the blast is then mobbed by the more numerous and faster firing blasters of the Gilzeans. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAA,A standard platoon of Greater Maldrood Army Troopers composed of two synergistic elements. Some squads are equipped with repeater slugthrowers and rapid firing carbines to suppress enemy infantry while other squads take advantage of this base of fire to finish off the enemy with their grenade launchers. These platoons of Army Troopers are found across the breadth of the Greater Maldrood’s domain as garrison forces or serving as line soldiers for the army. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAB,A small detachment of Imperial Army Troopers that is lightly armed, with only a single light repeater per squad to bolster the firepower of the unit's carbines and grenades. Despite lacking the numbers or firepower to do most tasks, a small detachment can still be of use by manning remote outposts across the Teradoc brothers' domains in the Mid Rim or Deep Core on the watch for the New Republic or rival warlords.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAC,The Greater Maldrood army commanders preferred doctrine for ground warfare emphasises high mobility and rapid shock action. To enable this ground commanders need good intelligence of local conditions and enemy positions. Scout Troopers mounted on 74-Z Speeder bikes are constantly sent to range out ahead of any GM ground formations to detect enemies. While the speeder bike has a weapon to enable it to harass enemy forces, it is much more preferable for the scouts to wait for the better armed AT-RT walkers to catch up and do the majority of the fighting.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAD,Army Guards which have been tasked with defending the bases of the Greater Maldrood's army can also be deployed onto the field to protect important locations, such as command posts or trauma stations. In the latter case, the Army Guard can also send squads forward with medical teams to keep the medics safe as they work to stabilise and treat any casualties.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAE,The forward elements of a Greater Maldrood assault, Combat RTTs race up to the identified weak point of the enemy line with its anti-infantry and anti-vehicle lasers blazing. When they reach the enemy position, the infantry transported by the RTTs disembark to assault the position. Army Trooper Assault Squads engage in close quarters combat while Fleet Commandos provide sniper and heavy weapons fire in support. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAF,A formation composed of three different reconnaissance vehicles tasked with locating and skirmishing with enemy forces to buy time for other units to arrive. 74-Zs are the most mobile of the three and are tasked to range out and locate any hostiles. The Infantry Support Platform is noticeably slower than the speeder bikes but is much more durable alongside their enhanced firepower. This allows the ISP to pin any light forces down, thus allowing the bikes to engage the enemy flanks in a safer manner. AT-RTs represent an assault component of the Mechanised Cavalry Task Force who sprint into any weak point created by the fighting of other elements while saturating enemies with blaster fire and grenades. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAG,The AT-AA is the standard anti-air vehicle used by the Galactic Empire and some of its later breakaway warlords. While it is lethal to any aircraft in its local vicinity, the walker itself is vulnerable to any ground attack. For this reason, it is common to assign ground units to escort it. While most warlords prefer infantry as close protection, both Kosh and Treuten Teradoc's Army commanders tend towards assigning AT-RT walkers as escort. These small walkers are capable of searching far more territory than squads of infantry while also having the firepower to deal with small raids aiming to take out the AT-AA.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAH,The INT-4 Interceptor is a cheap short-ranged interceptor used by the Galactic Empire, and was retained in the arsenal of the Greater Maldrood to supplement Mid Rim planetary patrols. It was commonly used as an advanced reconnaissance flyer which could also then harass any enemy positions it discovers with the underslung lasers. In addition to recon missions, they would also be tasked with undertaking strafing runs on any vehicle columns they spot. This would delay or even stop enemy reinforcements from engaging with the fast moving assault columns that were synonymous with the Greater Maldrood. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAI,The Swift Assault 5 was a hover vehicle renowned for its high speed and autonomy in addition to a good weapon loadout and armour. This led to it being adopted both as a front line hovertank combatant but also for a long range heavy scout. In the service of the both Greater Maldrood and Kosh Teradoc's Deep Core armies it is often partnered with smaller recon vehicles like the AT-RT, who can visually identify whatever is located by the Swift Assault’s sensor package. In return the Swift Assault provides a massive increase in combat ability over the smaller vehicles, and thus can safely engage a greater range of targets. The mobility of these units also leads to them being used to skirmish with any enemy assaults to delay their movement, allowing other allied forces to position themselves better.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAJ,The Imperial Security Bureau, ISB, would sometimes conduct raids against enemy positions to recover important data or neutralise a threat to the Empire. In these cases, they could requisition resources from local Imperial formations to assist. Navy Commandos provide additional firepower to the ISB Stormtroopers who the Commandos are glad to let lead the assault. Combat RTTs act as transport and fire support to the infantry while Infantry Support Platforms provide mobile fire support against any concentrations of infantry. 2-M Hovertanks are kept in reserve as insurance against any hostile reinforcements, or if a weak point is discovered during the raid. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAK,While Army Troopers are the main line infantry for the Greater Maldrood and are capable of conducting all the normal missions expected of regular infantry; there are targets where they need support from higher quality troops to be able to reasonably complete their mission. This can come in the form of a detachment from the Fleet Commandos, whose elite snipers can be deadly to any infantry in their sights. In addition, an Imperial Security Bureau Assault Team can sometimes attach themselves to these assaults to ensure the proper recovery, or destruction if need be, of valuable intelligence after the assault has been successful.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAL,While not a regular frontline formation, this ad hoc formation is composed of elite snipers from the Imperial Security Bureau and squads of Imperial Army Troopers equipped with heavy weapons. These teams are normally formed when the ISB requires assistance with their other operations or when the ISB intervenes with front line operations. In the warlord states the Teradoc brothers established cooperation with local ISB cells became a necessity for both to manage their holdings, and in return Kosh and Treuten Teradoc could call on them for combat operations.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAM,The A5 Juggernaut is a massive assault vehicle that became popular during the Clone Wars and remained in service with the Empire. Not only is the design heavily armed and armoured, but in addition it has the capability to transport a significant infantry force. The Greater Maldrood doctrine of rapid shock assaults is reflected by commanders loading up their A5 Juggernauts with assault squads of Army Troopers. These assault teams can also be bolstered by attached specialist squads such as Imperial Security Bureau Stormtrooper squads.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAN,Sniper teams from both the Fleet Commandos and the Imperial Security Bureau are often deployed to assist Greater Maldrood's army detachments, either directly in combat or indirectly through infiltration, assassination, and reconnaissance. The demand for these sniper teams means that it is necessary for airborne transport to be utilised to facilitate their rapid relocation. MAAT dropships are the primary aircraft used by Greater Maldrood in this role, although it is common for them to be escorted by other aircraft like the INT-4 Interceptor to provide protection in hostile territory. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAO,In line with esoteric Imperial Army doctrines Greater Maldrood's commanders practiced, their preferred artillery system is a nimble hovercraft armed with a proton missile launcher instead of the normal cannon systems. This capability allows the vehicle to get to an advantageous or unexpected firing position, launch a massive barrage, and then relocate in seconds. This grants the vehicles a much greater chance of escaping counter battery fire and also the ability to keep up with fast moving assaults. In order to keep up with the artillery, AT-RTs are tasked with providing escort while Army Guard squads are tasked with protecting the battery when it is in a fixed position. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAP,The Heavy Armoured Assault Platoon is centred around a single A5 Juggernaut which is used as a battering ram to break into any enemy position. It is supported by the various medium-sized hover vehicles used by the local Imperial armies that swore fealty to Greater Maldrood. Swift Assault 5s use their enhanced sensor suites to spot targets and prevent any ambushes on the fast moving platoon. On the other hand, the 2-M Hovertanks stay in close support of the A5, where their firepower can assist in the destruction of all the enemies in the formation's path. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAQ,The high intensity manoeuvre doctrine of the Greater Maldrood's average army formation relies on the collection of real time, accurate information; but also the ability to rapidly neutralise strong points that are in a position to bog down advancing ground elements. The MAAT dropship is vital in providing the capability of airlifting elite assault teams promptly on the target, while also providing air support. Jump Troopers can also be assigned to assist without requiring more airlift capability. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAR,A Line Mechanised Squadron combines Army Troopers, their transports in the RTT (Combat), and the Swift Assault 5 Hoverscout, into a cohesive combined arms formation. A mechanised squadron is expected to be able to sustain high intensity operations and battle with all three combat elements working in tandem to cover each other's weaknesses. After Kosh Teradoc combined his Deep Core military build-up with his brothers, Heavy Recovery Vehicles were often attached to active squadrons in order to keep the vehicles running properly despite the rigours of battle and campaigning. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAS,When a cavalry squadron is assigned to protect the flanks of an advance or have been tied down in combat for a significant amount of time, then it is not uncommon for additional forces to be attached to the formation. More bikes allow for a greater intensity of skirmishing against the hostile forces, while attached ground forces can join the increased numbers of AT-RT walkers in assaulting enemy positions. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_HAPES_AAA,An assault formation composed of infantry squads from both the Royal House and House Galney. Royal House Guards form the backbone infantry of any united Hapan ground force while contingents from the other noble houses provide specialist support. The soldiers from House Galney are renowned as efficient and dedicated assault troops within the Consortium. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_HAPES_AAB,A platoon of standard infantry troopers organised under the Royal House of the Hapes Consortium. In peace time they serve as a militarised police force across the worlds under the control of the Hapans to keep both the populace and noble houses in check. In times of war these troopers serve as the main line infantry and thus are equipped to deal with a wide range of situations they are likely to encounter in the field. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_HAPES_AAC,A platoon formed from contingents of two noble houses working in cooperation. The noble house of Requud has a long history of equipping its soldiers with a larger ratio of heavy weapons than normal which makes their formations excellent at combating vehicles. On the other hand the lighter House Galney soldiers are able to move in close under the cover of the heavy weapons fire from the House Requuad soldiers. In such close range the extensive Galney assault training shines. A single large Rana transport is assigned to each platoon to ensure tactical mobility and additional firepower. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_HAPES_AAD,The Water Dragon hover tank is the lighter of the two main hover tanks commonly utilised by the Royal House of Hapes ground forces and is focused heavily against any infantry threats. A small cluster of Water Dragons spell doom for any unaware infantry caught in their fire. A squad of Rana Transports are attached to each cluster of Water Dragons to provide additional anti-infantry fire; in addition to providing local commanders the chance to mechanise any Hapan infantry platoon operating in the same area although none are organically supplied to the Light Armoured Platoon. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_HAPES_AAE,The Hapan Royal House maintains formations of elite special forces operatives in reserve to use against any upstart noble house in times of peace or to covertly strike behind enemy lines in time of war. Their limited numbers however means they often rely on other forces for support. The soldiers from House Galney are a favourite for the Royal Guard Commandos to cooperate with due to similarities of tactical doctrine. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_HAPES_AAF,In times of war, House Maluri provides their House troopers to serve as medical and mechanical specialists. Those who are not qualified in those specialties keep their compatriots safe with their ceremonial but still lethal slugthrowers. Line soldiers from the Royal House are also traditionally tasked with keeping the Maluri specialists safe when they are operating on the battlefield. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_HAPES_AAG,Flying in two elements of two, the Silanus speeder is the air speeder of choice for the Hapes Consortium for reconnaissance and skirmishing duties. Reliant on its shielding and high speed for protection, flights of Silanus speeders can make short work of vehicles with their lasers while their grenade launchers deal with clusters of infantry.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_HAPES_AAH,The Fire Dragon is a rarely deployed asset of the Hapan Ground Forces as it is only required when there are a lot of enemy vehicles active or if they have deployed heavy walkers or tanks. In these situations the Hapans attempt to use a large amount of Firedragons at once to drown the enemy in slow firing super heavy laser fire. Waterdragon squads draw fire away from the valuable Firedragons in addition to engaging any enemy infantry. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_HAPES_AAI,Based on the Water Dragon chassis, the Parallax is a mobile proton missile launcher which can fire devastating barrages of proton missiles. The Hapans tend to keep these systems in reserve to avoid damage to their own cities, but will deploy the Parallax in battles away from their own urban areas or when on offensives outside the Cluster. Royal Guard infantry provide protection for each launch system as it is extremely vulnerable when its stabilisers are active, which lock the vehicle to the ground. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_HAPES_AAJ,The Heavy Air Squadron is based around a single element of Vhork Gunships and their heavy AV beam lasers which make short work of all but the toughest ground vehicles, while lighter lasers from the Vhorks engage vehicle and infantry alike. Two Flights of Silanus Speeders provide support by engaging any enemy crippled by the barrage of laser fire from the Vhorks and also distracting any enemy airspeeders active in the area. Braver pilots of the Silanus speeders also engage any enemy air defence systems to fix their attention. They do this while also providing targeting data back to the Vhorks which can then destroy anti-air emplacements hopefully before the Silanus speeder is shot down. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_HAPES_AAK,The Royal Household Troop is a ground force unit under the direct control of the Hapan Queen and only can be deployed with her orders. The primary component is specialist teams of elite Royal Favoured Guard teams along with Royal Guard Commando teams. This strong core of special forces is supported by the second component of the troop which is composed of a rotation of Auxilia from House troops belonging to some of the stronger Hapan Noble families. Soldiers from House Galney provide additional assault troops which while lacking the same training of the Royal Guard Commandos have far greater numbers. Meanwhile Medics from House Maluri do their best to minimise casualties taken by these highly prestigious soldiers. Rana Transports are always made available to them to ensure maximum battlefield mobility.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_HAPES_AAL,The Hapan Royal Guard Reserve Troop are an extremely mobile formation under the direct command of the Hapan Queen. Both infantry elements of the troop are led by a team from the Hapan Royal Favoured Guard leading teams of Royal Guard Commandos. The “Heavy” element is extensively equipped with heavy and light repeater blaster rifles resulting in a deadly barrage of firepower. The “Sniper” element is composed solely of experienced markswomen with sniper rifles. Both elements are trained to work in close cooperation with Vhork Gunships which can provide rapid air mobility and heavy anti-vehicle firepower. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAA,As the Empire crumpled after the Battle of Endor, Imperial ground forces were forced to deviate from their long held standard formations due to manpower and equipment shortages. Lacking the required Heavy Weapons Teams mandated for the formation of an Assault Platoon, old Dwarf Spider Droids were reactivated as a replacement. The DSD heavy weapons lay down destructive covering fire for the Imperial Army Assault squads to close on and destroy an enemy position. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAB,In order to maintain control over more remote worlds the Empire needed to establish lots of small outposts. The high speed of the speeder bikes allows the garrison of the base to patrol and thus control a massive area of the planet around their base. While the Scout Troopers maintain their vigil over the remote planet, guards maintain the security of the base. However, long periods of relative inactivity and boredom have impacted their combat readiness. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAC,Imperial doctrine before the Battle of Endor dictated the standard Order of Battle for the Imperial Army. This organisational structure was heavily disrupted by the fragmentation of the Empire following the Emperor’s death. Despite this, some forces still managed to adhere to the existing doctrine. The standard Imperial line platoon is expected to be the building block of many larger Imperial Army forces although their actual equipment could vary depending on local supply. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAD,No matter how proficient a combat force is, it will always take some casualties in battle. Imperial medics rush around the battlefield to keep valuable Imperial forces alive and attend to the wounds they have taken. To do otherwise would be a criminal waste of personnel in a time when manpower is an issue for the Empire. Optionally, Chariot LAVs can be attached to the medic squads to facilitate their rapid transit around the battlefield and to carry additional medical supplies. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAE,Stormtroopers are the elite mainline infantry of the Empire; however they serve under a different chain of command from the regular Imperial Army. These well drilled and highly motivated soldiers are given some of the best equipment available in return for being expected to spearhead all the major assaults taken out by the Empire, while maintaining a constant rapid reaction ground force. The decline of the Empire forced some Stormtrooper units to reactivate old battle droids such as the Dwarf Spider Droid in order to supplement the capabilities of a platoon or to mitigate the impact of losses due to lack of manpower.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAF,Although the Empire normally organises vehicle platoons into groups of the same vehicle model, mounting battle losses combined with problems securing consistent resupply make this difficult to achieve. This has forced many formations to use a mix of vehicle types in order to ensure each platoon is large enough to be combat effective. Light Walkers such as the anti infantry AT-PTs form small sections and act as the spearhead of any operation the platoon undertakes. Meanwhile more mobile Chariot LAV repulsorcraft form a small reserve which can rapidly react when enemy light armour is encountered.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAG,In order to compensate for lacking the vehicle required in their official Table of Organization and Equipment, some commanders took to militarising vehicles commonly found in their local vicinity. The Treaded Neutron Torch was one such vehicle which became utilised as an ersatz heavy assault tank in Imperial-held regions such as Kessel. Combat experience with the converted mining vehicle found the design to be highly capable against enemy vehicles and fixed fortifications but its weaponry proved ineffective against small mobile targets like infantry. Thus it became common practice to partner the TNT with smaller vehicles such as the PX10 which could act as a screen against infantry and small vehicles. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAH,Scout Troopers are an elite branch within the Stormtrooper Corps who were given exceptional autonomy for Imperial soldiers. This was necessary for them to perform their far reaching missions such as long range reconnaissance. While Scout Troopers often spend their time on speeder bikes, granting them the speed and endurance to range out from their base, they could also often dismount if their mission required. Scouts are renowned as snipers and teams of dismounted scout sniper teams can wreak havoc at long range. As the snipers take their toll on the enemy, speeder mounted Scouts raid enemy lines to keep them pinned or finish off those hiding from the sniper teams. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAI,Sniper rifles and speeder bikes are not suitable for all of the missions assigned to Scout troopers. Occasionally Scout Troopers are required to amass a sizeable formation and assault a location on foot using weapons akin to those used by regular Stormtroopers. Assault teams rush onto the objective with carbines and a copious amount of grenades while commando teams sneak into preferential overwatch positions and rain down fire with heavier weapons. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAJ,Despite extensive training and high quality equipment assaults are often costly affairs that inflict high casualties on the combatants involved. Thus Stormtrooper medics follow in the wake of assault teams to find wounded Stormtroopers and, depending on the severity of the injuries, either stabilise them enough to be extracted to a proper medical facility or patch them up sufficiently so they can rejoin the fight. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAK,AT-AA walkers are the standard ground based anti-aircraft for the majority of the Imperial factions. However, while its flak pod is extremely capable of dealing with hostile airborne threats, the AT-AA is extremely exposed to any ground based threats. Even when the walkers are located behind the front line where they are ostensibly safe from ground attacks, it is important to keep up a guard force around the battery to protect it from enemy raids. Reluctant to “waste” manpower keeping an infantry screen around the vehicles, most Imperial commanders delegate the task to re-commissioned battle droids. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAL,Despite the Table of Organisation and Equipment dictating that a Medium Armour Platoon should have eight vehicles, the reality of long term intensive warfare means that platoons frequently fall below their authorised strength. Replacement vehicles are regularly not available or are awaiting delivery from a distant world. As a result, while walkers and repulsor vehicles are meant to be in separate platoons, under-strength platoons on a campaign may temporarily be merged together to form a viable force for the duration of the equipment shortage.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAM,The Deathhawk is one of the many airspeeder designs utilised by the Galactic Empire. Deployed in formations of three airspeeders, Deathhawks patrol vast areas of a planet to ensure there are no threats to the Empire present. If threats were located, they could inflict devastating strafing runs on ground targets. A preferred tactic was to have one speeder strafing the target, meanwhile a second would be resetting for a new attack run and the third would be lining up for its run to ensure a constant carousel of fire on an enemy. A Scout Trooper can be attached to the formation of Deathhawks in order to act as a forward air controller, coordinating the airspeeders and ground elements in the local area.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAN,The Imperial Military frequently use walker designs for their ground vehicles, with the AT-ST being a ubiquitous design across the Empire. The walker is a highly versatile vehicle capable of being used and refitted for many different roles beyond its initial recon designation. The base frame is capable of long range independent operations in small groups or acting as a supporting element for a larger force. No matter what it is being deployed for, the AT-ST is a highly devastating foe for any infantry or light vehicle. However, with the decaying industrial and logistical abilities of the Empire, its walker platoons often need to substitute in the outdated AT-PT to replenish them to full strength.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAO,A mobile platoon of heavy weapon droids and veteran stormtroopers entrusted with heavy or exotic weapons. A rare asset to field commanders which operate outside of the normal Order of Battle, but act as a platoon to be attached where needed. Their firepower can assist regular formations in an attack by suppressing the enemy or destroying strong points, or can be used to bolster a defensive position. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAP,The S-1 FireHawke was a prominent hovertank used by the Galactic Empire and the later Imperial Remnant, although it had started to be phased out by the newer 1-H Imperial Hover Tank by the time of Palpatine’s death at Endor. The turmoil this created forced the majority of the Imperial Army to keep using the older Firehawke for its repulsorlift armour needs. Normally deployed with only 4 vehicles to a platoon, when heavy combat is expected the Order of Battle of the Imperial Army allowed for additional vehicles to be attached to the platoon to bolster its strength. A single Chariot acts as the command vehicle of the platoon where the commander can use the extensive sensor and communications gear aboard the vehicle to maintain tight control over the platoon. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAQ,Shadow Stormtroopers operate as the elite agents of the elusive Agent Blackhole and carry out dangerous missions for their master. This ranges from infiltration, assassination, or sabotage. On occasion Dark Jedi who have subordinated themselves to Agent Blackhole are attached to these squads to lead them into battle and assist in the completion of missions of extreme importance. With the advanced stealth cloaks of the Shadow Stormtroopers and the Force-enhanced skills of Dark Jedi they would prove a lethal combo to targets of Blackhole's wrath.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAR,The indomitable AT-AT is the mainstay assault vehicle of the Empire. The slow but steady advance of a platoon of these heavy walkers often spells doom to any opponent of the Empire. However infantry getting into close range or forces which manage to outflank the lumbering beasts can pose a serious threat to AT-ATs. Thus they are nearly always deployed alongside the support of smaller and faster vehicles to shepherd the enemy into areas in front of the walker’s advance. AT-STs provide escort to the lumbering walkers to keep away hostile infantry at a safe distance from the exposed underbelly of the AT-ATs. Normally infantry would also be tasked to provide escort but as the Empire decays into the Imperial Remnant manpower shortages often mean reactivated Dwarf Spider Droids are used instead.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAS,The massive A5 Juggernaut is an extremely fast assault vehicle which can rapidly close on any enemy position while its heavy armour shrugs off any enemy fire. The A5 also possesses numerous weapon batteries which can be turned on enemy positions to devastating effect. Although some would claim the best weapon of the A5 is its cavernous hold in which multiple squads of infantry can be transported. More often than not, these would be squads of Stormtroopers and when disembarked these fearsome troopers would mop up the dazed survivors of the Juggernaut’s rapid blitz.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAT,The Self-Propelled Medium Artillery walker comes in several variants which swap the primary weapon system depending on the mission requirements. SPMA walkers required for indirect fire are equipped as the grenade variant which lobs a powerful high explosive shell at extreme range. This weapon system massively outranges the sensors onboard the SPMA and thus SPMA-Gs are reliant on other forces to provide accurate targeting information. Such a complex job is difficult without specialised equipment such as that found on command vehicles like the PX-4 Mobile Command Base. The presence of such a vehicle means that a fire mission can be called upon seconds after an enemy presence is detected within the range of the formidable artillery system.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAU,The Elite Guard are a special shock formation of the Stormtrooper Corp deployed to protect VIPs, especially when they are near warzones. Their protection duties do not confine them to standing close by to their VIP, but necessitate rapid relocation in addition to securing positions ahead of the VIP. Some squads of the Elite Guard also stand by in reserve along with their gunship transports in order to respond rapidly in case any threat is detected. The IDT is commonly used in this role due to its well-rounded combat abilities and respectable troop bay. This means that the IDT can deploy its squads even in a hot LZ, join the fight against any threat, or extract the VIP safely while under fire. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAV,A vast concentration of Imperial air power, with several flights of Imperial Dropship Transports working in coordination to rapidly apply firepower to any hostile ground target. They also provide mass airlift capability for any infantry on the battlefield which needs to redeploy. An element of Deathhawk airspeeders provide reconnaissance capabilities to the squadron as they can locate and pin down any force far in advance of the arrival of the IDTs. Deathhawks also provide some ability to fight enemy airspeeders over the relatively slow moving IDTs. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAX,The exceptionally trained Nova Troopers are rarely seen in normal combat due to their usual duties guarding important positions. But when these locations came under attack, or the situation became desperate enough to deploy these elite soldiers, they took to the field to deadly effect. Their standard equipment makes them lethal to any infantry and light vehicles, making them perfect in close quarters assault missions or guarding the exposed underbelly of vehicles like the AT-AT or their upgraded TAT-AT variant. The latter being a refit which up-gunned the design yet was slow to roll out due to the constraints of post-Endor Imperial logistics. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAY,With the Empire struggling for manpower, they increasingly turned to automated vehicles and droids. This resulted in designs like the XR-85 Tank Droid becoming widely adopted. These behemoth droids make for fearsome combatants in a rapid frontal assault. Following in the wake of their devastating assault came the Dark Side enhanced Dark Stormtroopers. They bring with them excessive amounts of firepower per squad compared to every other infantry formation, with heavy repeating blasters and devastating turbocannons. Anything which managed to survive the Tank Droids would be dispassionately gunned down by the artificially-enhanced Stormtroopers. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAZ,There are a wide variety of elite Stormtrooper formations under the Empire, such as the alchemically Dark Side-infused Dark Stormtroopers and the Royal Guard Stormtroopers, bodyguards of the Emperor, both of which are rarely seen in actual combat. These forces are only deployed in the most vital or desperate battles for the Empire. In terrestrial battles these elite troops are always accompanied by supporting vehicles, like the Imperial Dropship Transport, which transport and assist them in battle. Stormtroopers utilising jetpacks can also accompany the IDTs to provide additional infantry mass to the assault. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_ABA,In order to aid their troubled ground forces which were heavily strained by the Galactic Civil War, the portions of the Empire under the Ruling Council would seek upgraded versions of their older war gear. The infamous AT-AT would see its weapons system upgraded from laser cannons to turbolasers which provided a massive increase in firepower. The AT-ST would also see upgrades to their weaponry with the AT-ST/A variant. The Empire hopes these increases in firepower would result in better battlefield results. Shortages of manpower mean that Dwarf Spider Droids, repurposed from remaining Separatist stockpiles under Imperial control, escort the walkers over infantry; although even these droids are present in smaller numbers than before. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAA,Following the Battle of Endor, the Rebellion and then New Republic grew in confidence and sought to liberate more worlds which were under the Empire’s tyrannical grasp. To do this often meant bloody close range infantry offensives against well equipped and entrenched Imperial garrisons. Well-armed with rapid firing carbines and grenades, determined assault teams would seek to close the distance rapidly before using their weapons to deadly effect. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAB,Despite growing in strength after the Battle of Endor, the fledgling New Republic came under frequent attack. When in a prepared defensive position the infantry of the New Republic often preferred to utilise rifles alongside heavier supporting weaponry in order to suppress and kill attackers at long range. T2-B tanks were sometimes assigned to reinforce infantry which were low on manpower in order to supplement their firepower. The tank’s mobility also allowed it to harass the enemy forces as they advanced into range or pick off isolated groups of attackers. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAC,Despite their transition from the Rebellion into the New Republic, NR infantry still remained as varied in quality, equipment and species as they did in their Rebellion days. Those soldiers with longer range or heavier weapons were grouped into line formations which could lay down suppressive and destructive fire on the enemy. Then infantry with shorter range or lighter weapons would close in on the suppressed to finish off the pinned enemy. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAD,The ground battles of the New Republic were often extremely infantry focused and thus could see large amounts of casualties. Medics would rush around the battlefield to try and save as many lives as possible even if this meant putting themselves into extreme danger. NR infantry would often seek to protect the lives of the medics in knowledge they would never know if it would be them who needed the medics attention next. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAE,The New Republic Marines were an elite force within the New Republic military and one of the few groups ensured to receive good and standardised gear. They were often the spearhead of planetary assaults and heavily entrenched positions. Their relative rarity and high competency often meant they got priority for supporting assets such as makeshift APCs to transport them to the frontlines and get the Marines into the range of their weaponry. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAF,The New Republic made frequent use of small and nimble repulsor vehicles. AAC-2s could appear out of nowhere and unleash a massive hail of missiles on unsuspecting targets, while using their cannons on any survivors of the barrage or on hardened targets. Freerunners could duel any heavier enemy vehicles or act as a blocking force if the enemy was stronger than expected. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAG,Rather than being a normal formation which serves in the regular chain of command, this squad was designed to serve as an attachment to other formations to provide both anti-air and medical capabilities. When attached to a formation the infantry provide security to the batteries of T1-B tanks while the medics either are detached to help on the frontline or set up a secure position to tend to the wounded. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAH,After the devastation caused from the Dark Empire, the New Republic was forced to reorganise their entire infantry order of battle. The infantry became more professional and standardised in a bid to reduce battlefield losses. The standard Rifle Platoon grew in size to become more resilient to battlefield losses while also increasing the firepower under its command. Also greater numbers of light tanks such as the T2-B were frequently attached to the platoon to bolster their firepower and serve in support of the infantry. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAI,The reduced infantry manpower available to the New Republic due to the many bloody campaigns and crises like the Dark Empire crisis, meant that mobility for existing infantry became even more as a premium. Gallofree HTTs are capable of providing extreme tactical level mobility to several infantry squads at a time. This allowed them to be redeployed rapidly to reinforce any faltering positions or exploit a weakness in the enemy’s formation. Elite Infiltrator teams often attach themselves to these airmobile groups to provide commando support or additional recon capabilities.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAJ,The Rebellion and early New Republic was often not capable of combined arms operations due to the lack of equipment such as the tanks to do so; however when all the pieces were present on the battlefield they would utilise such tactics. The heavy T3-B tanks could demolish enemy positions and vehicles with their torpedoes and heavy lasers. Meanwhile the elite marines would push forward under the cover of the tank’s fire in order to engage any enemy infantry cowering in cover at close range with rapid firing blasters and flamethrowers.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAK,A popular civilian airspeeder which the Rebellion had converted into a military craft, the T-47 remained in service for the New Republic in many different variants from frontline combat to dedicated recon and ironically even converted back to utility purposes on occasion. This flight of T-47s are configured to the assault variant which was immortalised for their heroic defence of Echo Base on Hoth. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAL,The Scout and Retrieval Vehicle was one of the few new vehicle adoptions of the NR post-Endor, although it largely served with second or third echelon formations which were not expected to see heavy combat. This meant it was often seen with garrisons on backwater or unimportant worlds. Similarly, despite the army reforms of the NR after the Dark Empire, not every foot soldier was able to rapidly adapt to the new standards or simply could not receive the new equipment due to the burden of galactic wide logistics. Thus it would not be uncommon to find groups of NR infantry armed in a similar manner to how they were armed in the Rebellion even late into the NR’s rule. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAM,As the New Republic settled into its place in the galaxy, the Jedi Order was slowly reformed under the guidance of Luke Skywalker. As their number grew, more and more Jedi would slowly involve themselves with galactic affairs and take roles within or alongside the NR forces despite never reaching the numbers of the Old Republic's Order. While some Jedi placed themselves in the position of most danger, others preferred to bolster elite strike forces such as Marines, who also liked to engage the enemy at close ranges. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAN,The T4-B tank was one of the heaviest ground vehicles available to the New Republic ground forces. Armed with long range concussion missiles and heavy lasers, it was a potent vehicle despite its lack of speed. Nimble T2-B tanks acted as forward scouts to spot enemies for the longer range weapons of the T4 before falling back to cover the flanks of the lumbering T4-Bs, or breaking off to harass the enemy’s flanks. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAO,The Freerunner proved to be a reliable mainstay of the New Republic’s repulsor vehicle fleet, and was significantly more capable than the majority of the other repulsorlift vehicles which also tended to be smaller and lighter. Thus they would be massed when the NR expected to have a stand up battle against the enemy or needed a combination of firepower and mobility. The Heavy Tracker could support groups of Freerunners with the Tracker’s excellent sensors and long-range heavy laser. Its bulk could also provide some protection for the Freerunners as well when they needed to fall back to allow their shields to regenerate. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAP,Developed for the NR as a purpose built combat airspeeder, the V-wing proved to be highly potent and would rapidly start to replace the T-47 in combat roles. With a heavy armament and good speed, the V-wing was a lethal threat not only to hostile ground vehicles but could also reliably engage and defeat enemy airspeeders and fighters which had entered the atmosphere. Their effectiveness would lead to most worlds having garrisons of these speeders, and the NR often brought them along in special transports when attacking enemy worlds.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAQ,The Mobile Proton Torpedo Launcher-2a was the artillery system of choice for the New Republic, however it was fragile and needed to be set up before it was capable of firing. This necessitated that the vehicle stayed safely behind the frontlines, however this still left it exposed to aerial attacks. Thus competent commanders often protected the MPTL with batteries of T1-B tanks, which could shoot down air attacks with their flak pods. Backline infantry provided security for the vehicles to prevent any infiltration raids on them. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAR,Intended to punch through the layers of defensive positions on Imperial fortress worlds, a group of MAS-2xB siege platforms leaves little standing where they fly. V-wing combat speeders provide protection from enemies attempting to flank the unwieldy targets, or can use their speed and sensors to spot for long-range fire.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAS,The T3-B and T4-B were some of the heaviest and most capable ground vehicles commonly used by the NR. They were frequently scattered around in small numbers in supporting roles but when ground forces encountered a heavily entrenched foe or a massive ground force, these tanks could be concentrated into heavy squadrons. In these formations the combined mass of heavy laser fire along with volleys of concussion missiles and proton torpedoes was capable of rapidly destroying any ground target. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAT,While the T-47 was a highly popular airspeeder in the New Republic Military, the rigours of the high intensity warfare that occurred after the death of Palpatine at Endor exposed many weaknesses to the design. The V-wing was intended to be a successor to the T-47, but its rollout would prove slow. Thus, many of the older T-47s would be forced to remain in front line service to make up the numbers required. When these older formations found themselves in important campaigns, flights of the newer V-wings could be attached as reinforcement. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAA,A standard platoon of the Alignment's Army troopers are composed of two synergistic elements. Some squads are equipped with repeater slugthrowers and rapid firing carbines to suppress any infantry while other squads take advantage of this base of fire to finish off the enemy with their grenade launchers. These platoons of Army Troopers are found across the breadth of the Alignment's domain as garrison forces, or serving as line soldiers for the army. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAB,Members of the Pentastar Patrol who have been pressed into military service. Originally meant to simply replace army and navy troopers in garrison roles to free the latter for front line service, sometimes these forces themselves have been forced into fighting on the frontline. They mostly fight with a standard mass produced carbine, with the only supporting weapons regularly afforded to Enforcer squads being a singular cheaply acquired missile system for anti-vehicle duties. Despite this they act with an earnest zeal on the front, thinking they are fighting for the galactic way even when defending corporate interests.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAC,Alignment Army Troopers liberally equipped with grenades can be paired with AT-PTs in order to form teams adept at seeking down and crushing any infantry or revolts among such groups as the Entymal slave labor of Dynamic Automata. The blaster cannons on the AT-PT and carbines of the Army Troopers force enemy infantry into cover. After which both can freely use their grenades to destroy the pinned infantry at will. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAD,Army Guards which have been tasked with defending the bases of the Alignment's Army can also be deployed into the field to protect important locations such as command posts, trauma stations, or at the urging of Chamber of Order members their own corporate fiefdoms. For the former the Army Guards can also send squads forward with medical teams to keep the medics safe as they work to stabilise and treat any casualties. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAE,A Light Walker platoon for the Alignment's army is composed of two elements. The heavy squad in the platoon is composed of AT-DPs, larger walkers which are suited for engagements against vehicles and fortifications with its blaster cannon. The second element is the light squad which is composed of the smaller AT-PTs, which are aptly suited towards crushing any enemy infantry. Thus in tandem these two specialised walkers can be used in a capable generalist formation capable of engaging any threat on the battlefield within the same size range. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAF,Internal Security Operator teams are the main combat infantry for Imperial Intelligence. At times these troops are deployed to regular battlefields for specific missions. If their target is heavily protected then IntSec Operators are not above requisitioning the soldiers away from base defence along with heavy weaponry in order to provide extra firepower, and of course serve as a handy meat shield for the Operators. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAG,A pair of TIE Maulers form an extremely rapid and dangerous strike formation which is lethal to any infantry, and at times civilians, who are in their way as they are shredded by rapid firing blaster cannon or crushed under the Mauler’s treads. When there is a chance of the strike team encountering a vehicular threat then AT-DPs can be tasked to follow on in their wake. This provides the Maulers a safe point where they can retreat and thus lure the hostile vehicle into the AT-DPs guns. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAH,Being mostly positioned in the Northern Galactic Rim, the Pentastar Alignment had retained a far greater percentage of Clone War surplus than other areas of the Empire due to being lower priority for new equipment. Thus instead of the more common AT-AA, the Alignment is forced to use the Clone Wars era UT-AA despite its shortcomings. As it is exposed to any form of ground attack, infantry with heavy weapons are nearly always stationed as pickets around the vehicle to keep it well protected on the battlefield. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAI,The aging Gaba-18 was pressed into service during the Clone War primarily in a reconnaissance role and still saw occasional use in military roles during the Galactic Civil War. More commonly they were relegated to garrison and security roles where their weak weapons would not be a hindrance, while their high mobility would allow a garrison to patrol a large area, in addition to allowing them to rapidly react to calls for aid from the garrison infantry if they ever encountered problems. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAJ,Similar to the Light Walker Platoon, the Alignment's Tracked Platoon is composed of a heavy squad which utilises TIE Crawlers and Light Squads which use the TIE Maulers. The turbolaser of the TIE Crawlers are lethal against any vehicle encountered by the platoon, while the nimble TIE Maulers keep any infantry away from the sluggish TIE Century tank. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAK,The officers who comprise the Imperial Army Commandos are best used in missions making use of rapid movement and heavy firepower. Internal Security Sniper Teams might attach themselves to an Army Commando platoon when they go out on a raid to ensure important intel is recovered. These snipers can also provide deadly accurate fire to assist the Commandos in overrunning their target. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAL,The Commission for the Preservation of the New Order provided some of the most fanatical supporters and believers of the Empire, and Imperial warlords wasted no time co-opting elements of the organisation for their own benefits. The fanatical troops of CompForce made for excellent assault soldiers which could be augmented by the addition of the Guardian Protector squads of the Pentastar Alignment. These former COMPNOR soldiers make good assistance to their former branch personnel, especially when they liberally use their flamethrowers to flush out enemies from their cover. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAM,The B5 Juggernaut's weaponry is lesser compared to the A5, but in its stead gained a much larger capacity for transporting soldiers. Alignment Army Troopers make up the mass of the soldiers being transported, but in important assaults more elite soldiers can augment the squads of the Army. Lower grade members of the Protectorate Branch can assist the assault teams in the close quarter battles while Army Commandos provide assistance with their better weapons. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAN,The Nemesis gunship was a favoured aircraft in the service of the wealthy planets in the Empire, and the rich corporate leaders in the Velcar Free Commerce Zone were keen on it especially. The VFCZs signing of the Pentastar Alignment Treaty made it an easy complement to the newfound state's military arm. Often they would be deployed in a “heavy” squad as a pair alongside “light” squads composed of groups of the tiny Gaba-18 Speeders. These Gabas could provide targeting data for the Nemesis, harass anti-air emplacements, or finish off targets weakened by the fire from the Nemesis.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAO,The twin barrelled Heavy Artillery system commonly deployed by the Alignment has greater than normal mobility and rate of fire than most other batteries used by Imperial factions. That rate of fire has come at the cost of reducing the damage each shell is capable delivering. When battlefield conditions prevent the battery from rapid and constant relocation, squads of Enforcers are commonly positioned as a protective screen for each vehicle to ensure their safety, while also not tying down more capable troops in rear line duties. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAP,Heavy assault firepower is occasionally required to quickly break strong defensive positions and annihilate significant enemy forces. To that end, the Alignment's military leaders designed a heavy unit complete with strong defensive siege platforms that could move around the battlefield at will, heavy artillery for saturation bombardment, and anti-air tanks to protect the vulnerable artillery from enemy airspeeders and gunships.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAQ,The Pentastar Alignment, through the public allegiance of Great InQuestor Jerec, acquired many former members of the Imperial Inquisitorius early on. This provided them access to Dark Jedi who, upon request, could be assigned to assist the army in their operations. These Dark Jedi would also likely be assigned Guardian Protectors as bodyguards due to their high status in the alignment. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAR,When a world or corporate member of the Pentastar Alignment gets attacked, its heavily militarised security forces are quick to react to help contain the enemy until stronger forces can arrive. Enforcer squads rush towards the enemy in an attempt to drown them in bodies and carbine fire while the AT-DPs, normally kept in reserve for quelling mass disturbances, seek out and engage any vehicles the enemy brings for the invasion. Gaba speeders roam the sky to provide up to date intel back to the local area commanders and occasionally launch strafing runs on infantry in the open. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAA,A standard platoon of Zsinj's Army troopers composed of two synergistic elements. Some squads are equipped with repeater slugthrowers and rapid firing carbines to suppress any infantry while other squads take advantage of this base of fire to finish off the enemy with their grenade launchers. These platoons of Army Troopers are found across the breadth of Zsinj’s domain as garrison forces or serving as line soldiers for the army. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAB,A small detachment of Imperial Army troopers who are lightly armed with only a single light repeater per squad to bolster the firepower of their carbines and grenades. Despite lacking the numbers or firepower to do most tasks, a small detachment can still provide use by manning remote outposts and acting as an outer screen for larger forces. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAC,Every military force is only as good as its reconnaissance, and Zsinj’s forces are among the best in the galaxy at information gathering. Raptor troops on the standard 74-Z bikes could rush ahead and secure ground and the nearly as quick PX-10s could follow as reinforcements or make small sorties of their own to locate and strike at enemy forces.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAD,A task force drawn from several different troop formations which were all renowned for their extreme loyalty towards the New Order of the Empire. Now under the control of the Warlord Zsinj, these infantry forces are tasked with ensuring that all the worlds under the Warlord remain loyal to his dominion. Any rebellious thought or act against him is met with brutal force, matched with plenty of collateral damage. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAE,Army Guards which have been tasked with defending the bases of the Zsinj’s Army can also be deployed into the field to protect important locations such as command posts or trauma stations. In the latter the Army Guard can also send squads forward with medical teams to keep the medics safe as they work to stabilise and treat any casualties. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAF,The Repulsor Scout was extensively used by the Imperial army in difficult or hazardous terrain for reconnaissance. Their high mobility allowed them to cover much ground, but it was lightly armed and only suitable for engaging small groups of infantry. A single Chariot LAV acts as a command element for the two squads of Repulsor Scouts. Its weapon also provides the platoon with some capability at engaging other vehicles. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAG,The Compact Assault Vehicle/Wheeled 10 was a light one man tracked vehicle which was used in large swarms to engage infantry or primitive vehicles. While highly adept at engaging those targets, it struggled against any modern vehicle remotely capable of warfare. Hence it was common practice to have two squads of PX-10s form a light element of the platoon and then ULAVs could provide a heavy element in relative terms. The ULAV was still a fragile vehicle, but it had the mobility to keep up with the PX-10s and it possessed far more firepower including anti-vehicle capabilities. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAH,Units with unwavering loyalty to Warlord Zsinj often patrolled near the frontlines assuring that the rest of the military force was competently and efficiently executing their tasks. These units always contained COMPFORCE Observation units directed by a loyal officer in a Chariot LAV appointed by either Zsinj himself or his right hand man, General Melvar. As the units are near the frontlines they could be called on to assist in defensive or offensive operations and were also outfitted with rapid response PX-10 units. These vehicles also gave the formation the ability to persuade any hesitant Imperial forces that it was in their best interests to follow their orders and go into battle. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAI,Choosing to sideline the old white stormtrooper armour for improved protection and projecting a new image of power and legitimacy, Zsinj’s highly trained troopers, designated Raptors, struck fear into Zsinj’s enemies wherever they appeared. Raptor medic squads provide support and keep the combat troops in the fight even longer.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAJ,The AT-AA was the mainline anti-air vehicle of the Imperial army and was highly reliable although like all specialised support vehicles it was exposed to any ground based attack. A pair of PX-10s acted as a far ranging patrol to prevent any enemy getting into range of launching an offensive on the AT-AA. A Chariot would often be attached to the battery to provide a safe command and control vehicle or to assist the PX-10s against any vehicle based incursion they detect. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAK,The bulk of Zsinj’s military force for most operations consisted of well trained army troopers in both assault roles and defensive roles. APCs were provided to rapidly deploy the units to contested zones to assault enemy forces and hold the line against any counterattacks.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAL,For more sensitive or dangerous operations and engagements, Zsinj deployed his best troops. The fanatical EVO troopers excelled at clearing away any soft targets while the elite and highly trained Raptors took on the anti-armour role. The elite infantry units were provided strong aerial support from IDT gunships for rapid redeployment, fire support, or rapid disengagement if the objective had been completed.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAM,The SPMA-T was a direct fire variant of the SPMA series. This meant it lacked the indirect abilities and range of other Imperial artillery systems, but provided the troops on the front line extreme firepower on demand against any hardened target. Squads of Army Guards keep a secure perimeter around the vehicle. Meanwhile, a nearby Chariot LAV ensures a direct connection with the command elements of nearby forces and filters their communications to ensure rapid and accurate target acquisition. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAN,For long range engagements against both soft targets and enemy tanks, Internal Security Sniper Teams act as spotters for the AT-AP units accompanying them. The AT-AP can blast apart enemy tanks spotted by the snipers, while the snipers keep enemy infantry suppressed and unable to get close to the vulnerable artillery piece.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAO,Internal Security Operator teams are the assault formations operating under the purview of Imperial Intelligence. Their disruptor rifles provide them with increased firepower while also minimising any trace of their passing. Often they could be tasked with missions behind enemy lines, or find themselves in need of rapid relocation. Thus they would often operate with dropships such as the IDT, which could rapidly transport the operator teams to their landing zones, as well as safely extract them if they needed a hot extraction or hot landing. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAP,For planetary invasions, Zsinj deployed significant infantry forces, with transports as support to get the infantry to deployment zones as rapidly and efficiently as possible. This mobile force could easily storm any beach or assault and overwhelm any stronghold, securing new territory for Warlord Zsinj’s burgeoning empire.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HAPES_AAA,The isolationist Hapes Consortium proactively enforce their isolation by actively prowling the edges of their territory with fighter sweeps to detect and then intercept any intruder into their Cluster. Cheap versions of their mainstay fighters are used to fill the numbers required for such a task while a small group of bombers maintain contact with the fighters on patrol to act as reinforcement if any firepower above fighter grade weapons is required. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HAPES_AAB,Though the Hapans co-opted the local pirates as additional protection, occasionally the men needed a reminder of who really shouldn’t be targeted by raids. This force was usually enough to hold back the rogue pirates for a more organised response, if necessary.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HAPES_AAC,These ships are often kept on the move around the space of the Hapan Consortium in order to keep outsiders away. Their speed allowed them to react rapidly to any reports from the fighter patrols of hostile contacts and move to reinforce the fighters to either destroy the intruder or at least keep them pinned in place long enough for slower forces to arrive on the scene. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HAPES_AAD,The Nova Cruiser refit allowed the Hapan Navy to reduce the amount of ships needed in any Nova Cruiser formation due to the increased capability. It however is still escorted by several smaller ships which are able to screen for it or add their weight of firepower on a target. When needed, several Nova Cruiser refits with their escorts will combine together into a larger task force if a threatening enemy vessel is detected to drown the enemy in turbolaser fire. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HAPES_AAE,Nova Cruisers were often utilised as light carriers to secure early fighter presence in a battle, capable of defending themselves from most threats, Flare corvettes fill the gap and help to protect the ship and fighters from enemy strike craft.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HAPES_AAF,Hapan fighter wings often lead the charge into enemy engagements, clearing the path for their frigates or bombers to strike unimpeded by enemy strike craft. In an emergency they could also screen around the edges of a fleet formation to provide protection for any damaged ships to make a clean getaway from enemy bombers. Nobles often take the lead in their enhanced fighters in order to win personal glory in battle. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HAPES_AAG,The Mist Cruiser is a dedicated carrier in the service of the Hapan Royal Navy although it was never popular with them due its lack of weaponry for its size. Despite this, it is a design capable of rapidly transporting significant amounts of fighters and bombers to any battle while some Baidam corvettes were often found in escorting roles for the large carriers. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HAPES_AAH,The Coronal is a large logistical vessel which is used by the Hapan Royal Navy to keep its far flung patrols and task forces sustained and also to assist in post battle repairs. Pulsars often are found with the Coronals when they were aggressively deployed as the Pulsar’s long range heavy Ion cannons can disable any vessel which is threatening the logistical vessels before it gets close enough to be a threat. However the lack of anti fighter protection can be a concern for some Hapan commanders. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HAPES_AAI,Due to some restrictions Hapans dealt with involving turbolaser technology, physical munitions served as an adequate substitute in a variety of situations. The Magnetar could fire high explosive missiles from a distance while being protected by the Charubah if anything got too close.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HAPES_AAJ,The Neutron was a rare vessel in the Hapan Navy as it represented a massive shift in doctrine which was not widely accepted. Despite the cultural rejection of the doctrine the Neutron represented, the vessel was still accepted as it had some value as a centrepiece of formations where its durability provided the Hapan fleet a rare brawler which could match some of the larger vessels deployed by other Galactic Factions. While the enemy is distracted in a slugging match with the Neutron, escorting smaller vessels could easily position themselves to best provide supportive fire and ensure that the Neutron would win its fight. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HAPES_AAK,The mainstay of the Hapan Royal Navy, the Battle Dragon saw significant use throughout the Transitory Mists. Unique for the way the vessel shoots, the rapid stream of turbolaser and ion energy could melt through even significant enemy resistance in a matter of minutes.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HAPES_AAL,A more conventional fleet composition deployed in serious circumstances, the firepower of the capital ship Terephon combined with the medium frigate sized Charubah and backed by the lighter Olanji, turned the tide of many battles for the Hapan Royal Navy.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HAPES_AAM,Star Home, while imposing in size, is not really a warship. Therefore, when the ship was on the field to provide tactical and logistical support, the flying palace required heavy protection from the Hapan Royal Navy’s finest vessels, the Battle Dragon and the Terephon. To be selected to guard the Star Home was seen as an honourable, if dull, assignment.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAA,The Imperial forces left fighter garrisons on every single base and planet they possess. The TIE Fighter would be the mass of Imperial garrisons while the newer TIE Interceptors would bolster fighter groups where a threat was expected. TIE Bombers would suppress any ground threat or attack any capital ship approaching the area.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAB,Imperial Bases and convoys were frequently attacked by Fighters from the New Republic requiring them to invest heavily into anti fighter protection. Small task forces such as this would roam around the edges of Imperial bases and convoys, ready to intercept any such fighter raids. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAC,Carracks formed a backbone of the Imperial light cruiser fleet and was thus forced to perform a wide range of duties around Imperial space from small individual actions to fleet support. While highly versatile in what weapons could be installed on the frame, the Empire preferred to kit its carracks out for combat against large warships with ions and heavy turbolasers. Thus lacking any inbuilt anti fighter protection they could maintain a Clone Wars addition to their design and carry TIE fighters on external racks. These fighters could be rapidly launched in response to threats despite lacking the range or endurance to fly with the Carrack on their missions without the assistance. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAD,The Ton Falk was a widely used carrier that could be used to transport the Empire’s short ranged fighters and bombers into battle in a cheap space hull. These could be used to either supplement the fighter group of a pre existing task force or to give carrier support to a group that did not have enough or any fighters of their own while not tying down valuable Imperial Star Destroyers. Crusader corvettes fly in escort of the relatively defenceless carrier to protect it from any hostile fighter attacks. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAE,The predecessor design to the TIE/LN fighter and first of the TIE line the Empire would produce, the TIE Starfighter was widely considered outdated and officially retired from service or scrapped. However some would survive in remote or extremely low priority areas especially as the tempo of the Galactic Civil War increased as the extreme demand for fighters meant that not every planet and outpost of the Empire could secure a reliable supply of new equipment but was forced to make use of whatever was available. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAF,Despite the KDY Eidolon Strike Cruiser being an upgrade to the original Loronar design in many ways, it was only produced in small numbers due to the original design having a versatility and modularity which was lost by the KDY upgrade. Due to its small numbers the Eidolon was forced into bit part roles such as flagships for officials or occasionally as leader vessel and reinforcement for groups of Loronar Strike Cruisers.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAG,The Storm Commandos were an autonomous independent commando formation which did not align themselves to any single warlord post Endor. Instead they remained loyal to their original mission of hunting down the Rebellion wherever they could with covert operations. The Post Palpatine Empire would often be keen to support this group in a desire to reintegrate them into the greater framework of the Empire and thus would send them equipment or reinforcements such as several squadrons flying the TIE Defenders.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAH,The Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser was a design that was omnipresent throughout the galaxy before the Clone Wars and would remain in service in large numbers even in the Galactic Civil War. They could be found in planetary defence roles, fleet duty, or long range patrols. When on extended missions groups of DHCs could be escorted by larger strike craft such as the Skipray whose large size and hyperdrive gave it the endurance lacking in many of the Imperial fighters.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAI,An autonomous group that was willing to aid the Empire and other Imperial breakaway groups when their goals align, the Storm Commandos maintained the deadly TIE Hunter fighter which was an Imperial parallel to the famous X-wing but more capable against large ships. To ensure they can bring their payload onto target, they could be escorted by other fighters such as the fast A9 interceptor which was around in large numbers but not as popular in Imperial service as the TIE line. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAJ,Arriving in service in the waning periods of the Clone Wars, The Acclamator MK 2 was conceived to carry masses of turbolasers to shred the swarms of CIS frigates and corvettes and then bombard CIS factory worlds to glass when it was not viable or worthwhile to land ground troops. In many ways this ship’s role stayed exactly the same in the Galactic Civil War apart from its opponent changing to the Rebellion/New Republic rather than the CIS. Groups of these Acclamators were a feared enemy for any group of New Republic corvette or frigate.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAK,Despite non TIE line craft being in Imperial service for the entire existence of the Empire, they really only started to rise to prominence in the later periods of the Imperial Remnant. Decades of war had led to massive losses of Imperial fighter stockpiles and losses of planets and shipyards reduced production to the point that relying on the TIE line was no longer viable and new sources of craft had to be found. Once overlooked and marginalised fighters started to be found in greater and greater use across Imperial service the longer the war progressed.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAL,Designed by Grand Moff Tarkin to replace the ubiquitous Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser, the Vindicator would rapidly expand in Imperial service replacing the DHC completely in many areas of the galaxy and it would even be modified to produce other ship classes. Despite having a much greater hangar capacity than the DHC, additional support could be given to flotillas of Vindicators on long range missions with escorting Skiprays whose endurance was far greater than most fighters in Imperial service. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAM,Despite being an iconic vessel for the Rebellion and New Republic, the Nebulon-B was originally a ship designed for the Empire and would see extensive Imperial service through the Galactic Civil War with many different refits and variants appearing. This variant of the Nebulon-B was a direct reaction to the heavy reliance of the New Republic on shields to protect both its fighters and vessels. Nebulon-B Patrol Refits attached to Acclamator MK2 hunting groups provide important support in rapidly dropping the shield protection of NR warships to allow the array of turbolasers on the Acclamator to devastate the now helpless vessel. The Nebulon also provides much needed anti fighter screening for the Acclamations which had been noticed as a weakness of the vessel. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAN,The highly modular MTC would see many roles in Imperial service after its introduction during the Dark Empire period. One such role was for the maintenance and support of Imperial units with resupply and repairs. Despite the MTC having inherent combat capabilities and a small fighter complement, they were exposed to any determined attack and thus were high priority for escorts especially when operating near combat areas. The widely used Vindicator would be commonly used for such escort duties, one of the many tasks it had been designed to perform. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAO,The Victory Star Destroyer MK 1 originated during the Clone Wars but rapidly fell in popularity due to design flaws such as a terrible drive system resulting in poor speed. The VSD was produced in large numbers during the Clone Wars and thus remained a common ship in the Empire despite this lack of popularity. One role the VSD saw was acting as a mobile space artillery battery with its generous supply of missiles and launch tubes. Lack of speed also plagued the Lancer Frigate's service and often forced it to be relegated to non fleet duty as it was unable to keep up. However it was a viable choice to protect the VSD as its lack of speed stopped becoming a concern which allowed its numerous laser emplacements to shine. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAP,The Victory II fixed many of the shortcomings of the Victory I along with swapping out the missiles for ion cannons and thus made it far more popular in Imperial service. Large groups of VSD IIs could be found almost anywhere in the Empire on a wide range of missions against hostile vessels and space infrastructure. When a large battle was anticipated several VSD IIs could be grouped up in a single formation to create a massive battery of turbolaser and ion cannon fire which was devastating to all but the largest warships. Procursator Star Destroyers could also be attached to such formations to provide some anti fighter support to the VSDs beyond what the small Hangar groups of the VSDs could provide. The lighter weapons of the Procursator were also a benefit against groups of frigates or corvettes which the heavy weapons of the VSD might struggle to track. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAQ,Star Galleons were smaller but more numerous than the MTC and intended as a self escorting cargo ship. In Imperial Service they moved supplies to bases and fleets constantly to keep them as fully supplied and up to date with equipment as possible. In areas of high threat the armament of the Star Galleon would potentially not be enough to withstand a full on attack so additional escorts would be supplied to get the Star Galleon through the dangerous areas and to where it was needed. Nebulon-B frigates would commonly be assigned such escort duties that fulfilled the class’s original design goal. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAR,The TIE Defender was one of the most capable Imperial fighters put into production but it only saw production in limited numbers which resulted in it being given only to the Empire’s best pilots who could be trusted to make best use of the craft. Capable against fighters or large warships, could also be accompanied by other craft such as the Missile Boat, when commanders had a sense of irony or were unaware of the craft’s origin, which provided a much greater capacity to damage large capital ships with its extensive missile pods. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAS,Designed in parallel the Tector and Imperial Star Destroyer were intended to occupy different niches. The Tector possesses a far greater array of turbolasers with some missiles tubes in support and greater armour and shield protection. The ISD is intended for multipurpose duties with a large Hangar deck, anti fighter lasers, and ion weapons in addition to a good amount of turbolasers. When both ships work together they can cover the gaps in each other’s designs to dominate most fleets and task forces.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAT,Imperial Star Destroyer IIs was the mainstay of the Imperial navy and was unmatched for decades by any capital ship in its size range. Wherever problems emerged in the Empire, it was nearly always an ISD II rapidly responding to it and often able to resolve the threat without support. As the Rebellion grew and became the New Republic their starfighter threat grew and grew forcing an Imperial response with ships being detailed to escort the ISD. Procursator Star Destroyers mixed a potent anti fighter capability with respectable anti ship weaponry. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAU,The Allegiance represents a massive concentration of firepower into a single ship not much larger than the normal Capital ships. However the Allegiance is so focused on anti ship firepower it lacks any fighter escort and anti fighter protection. Thus Procursator Star Destroyers and Vindicator Heavy Cruisers are routinely assigned to protect the Battlecruiser due to their capabilities at destroying fighters and small ships.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAV,The House of Tagge were a Noble House who were closely aligned with Palpatine’s New Order. While Palpatine’s death shattered the Empire, the Imperial remnant still maintained good relations with this noble house and could access their private military forces when their interests aligned. Despite being large and powerful warships, The Tagge Battlecruisers has less of a focus on raw anti-ship firepower, bringing a larger hangar capacity to engagements to support the much higher firepower of the Praetor-II.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_IR_AAW,A common Imperial formation, Carracks utilise their long range guns to attrition enemy forces down before the main battle lines engage in combat. A squadron of Skiprays maintain position around the pack of carracks in order to provide anti fighter cover due to Imperial Carracks often forgoing lasers for ion cannons. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAA,A small group of Republic fighters on a local patrol responding to the growing battle. While the X Wing had grown to be the premier New Republic fighter, there were never enough of them to fulfil all the demands of the war. The ancestor of the X Wing, the Z-95, would remain a popular fighter craft in Republic service to make up numbers for low priority patrols and garrisons. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAB,A group of fighters from groups aligned to the NR. The New Republic expected its member worlds to maintain their own Planetary Defence Forces which could patrol their own local space and hold off or at least delay minor attacks. These local forces often used older or more obscure equipment than the main fleets of the New Republic.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAC,An independent wing of New Republic fighters and bombers. The Rebellion era doctrine of long range groups of fighters being able to rapidly respond to any crisis or attack fleeting targets of opportunity was maintained in the early eras of the New Republic. A-wings would engage and destroy enemy fighters in a rapid strike leaving the Y Wings free to deliver their payload on the desired target.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAD,Small task forces of corvettes and frigates maintained a constant patrol throughout the space of the New Republic to detect any pirate or Imperial incursion into Republic territory. These small forces were expected to be able to engage and destroy small threats or survive long enough to either escape from a major threat or for reinforcements to arrive on the scene. Sometimes these small groups would even be dispatched to raid weak Imperial outposts or exposed forces. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAE,A patrol group that would commonly be found along the Mid Rim and Outer Rim. Able to engage at greater range than corvettes and strike craft, these groups patrolled sectors for threats and could deal with larger, more organised enemies and pirate forces. Often these forces would reinforce other task forces as needed.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAF,A Quasar was a good cheap and small carrier option for the New Republic which enabled it to base a wing of fighter craft in an area of space which could then sortie out for as needed. CR90s would maintain a constant escort perimeter for the carrier to ensure its safety while its fighters were all out on missions. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAG,While all planets under the New Republic were expected to have their PDF, not all of them were rich enough to acquire or maintain modern equipment. These planets would often make do with craft salvaged and adapted from wreckage or captured from the battles which had enabled that planet’s liberation from the Empire. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAH,In areas where the NR expected some threat to its worlds but not expected to see a major incursion the New Republic would garrison a higher proportion of newer fighters than those in low priority areas. Thus seeing additional X-wing squadrons in addition to using older fighters like the venerable but still popular Headhunter to make up the desired numbers.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAI,The Verpine weapons and starfighter manufactory, Roche Industries, partnered with the Mon Calamari of the planet Dac to create an attack group that could respond to threats to their freedoms with significant firepower. With Verpine designed B-wings accompanying Mon Calamari heavy missile boats, the MC40a, this attack group could overwhelm any raiders from the Empire or particularly bold pirates.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAJ,A grouping of 4 Assault frigates was a standard NR task force used to pursue a target away from valuable locations. It was expected that the collection of firepower represented by the 4 Assault Frigates would more than compensate for any relative fragility of the ship. This firepower combined with their speed would allow the task force to hunt down and engage a wide range of threats. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAK,A wing of the popular and versatile X-wing fighters supplemented by newer E-wing escort and superiority fighters pressed into service to deal with the Thrawn Campaign. Teething problems with the design ensured that the X-wing fighter line remained more popular for decades to come.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAL,As the New Republic grew in size it found itself with more and more worlds it needed to garrison with fighters to maintain its presence and ensure the safety of the surrounding space. The Defender Starfighter would be a fighter designed by the New Republic largely for this role to allow the NR to replace the outdated fighters it had been relying on for this role while also freeing up valuable modern fighters for front line duty. A9s were also widely used alongside the Defender in this role due to the large number of A9 factory worlds falling under the Republic’s control and it being comparable in performance to the Defender. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAM,Despite originally not having a hyperdrive the Cloakshape possessed extremely high endurance for a fighter craft which made it highly suitable for modification into fighter capable of jumping long ranges away from a base to perform a mission deep in enemy territory or respond quickly to an incident far away from its station. This capability allowed it to perform escort for the equally high endurance H-wing which was also capable of delivering large amounts of ordinance onto a single target. While not fast in sublight this combination is capable of arriving at locations far away from any expected target, delivering extreme destruction on a target, and then retreating before any response can mobilise to the unexpected threat.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAN,Elite raiding forces often make use of A-wing fighters for lightning strikes on soft targets, though finding heavier craft that can keep hyperspace or sublight pace is challenging. B-wing/E’s feature improved speed and modularity that sees the craft used as a heavy courier and elite assault unit. While not at the same level as the speed-focussed A-wings, the flight performance is superior to other New Republic assault fighter and bomber options which allows it to perform better in the composition then those options.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAO,A small task force of newer vessels intended to operate on shorter duration patrols or as reconnaissance for a larger fleet. New Class Modernization guidelines limit the duration of independent operations compared to other vessel compositions, but the ships in question are more combat capable than most other vessels in their size class.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAP,Following the same doctrine as before, the New Republic updated the ageing Nebulon-B to the more modern Corona class frigate. Maintaining the task force’s role of patrolling Sectors and reinforcing smaller groups to defend against organised pirate raids or minor Imperial aggression.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAQ,Despite being an ageing design for the New Republic, the Quasar would remain in service as a carrier as it remained a cheap and effective method for mobile basing fighter wings. However as the New Class Project was in full swing Agave corvettes would start to replace the CR90 in anti fighter and picket roles.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAR,With the restoration of production of Assault Frigate Mk 2 line of ship the TOE for the standard pursuit group would be slightly edited. The MK 2 while still relatively rare in numbers gave the force a bulky centre piece to base their operations around while also providing additional firepower that specialised in dealing with the wide range of large Imperial ships. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAS,Introduced before the New Class Project rolled into full swing, The Belarus was idealised as a mass produced mid size warship meant to operate in large numbers. However its lack of fighter cover and long range weapons was deemed a weakness by some commanders who paired groups of Belarus’s cruisers with an older Liberator which could provide fighter cover and long range fire for the Belarus cruisers would rush into closer range to swarm its target with turbolaser fire.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAT,The New Class Modernization Project sought to make better use of fleet tenders, so this detail was made to fill that gap. The Hajen fleet tenders required protection, so the Sacheen frigate was slated as an escort for the vulnerable ships.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAU,Sullustan defence forces made excellent use of fighters and frigates designed and manufactured by the Sullustan corporation SoruSuub. These fighters and ships were used to great effect to fend off rampaging Imperial warlord forces following the battle Endor.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAV,Worlds and species brutalised, enslaved or near-depopulated by the Galactic Empire are not always comfortable receiving protection from ships and soldiers that resemble those used by their oppressors. The alien design of Mon Calamari warships is used to provide an effective security measure that avoids provoking diplomatic incidents or traumatic responses in the way more common designs can.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAW,With the X-wing capable of keeping up with the more modern E-wing, it was decided to pair the fighters. In combined wings, these fighters were able to maintain fighter superiority in engagements across New Republic territory and beyond, clearing the way for bombers and other units to take full advantage of the controlled battlespace.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAX,Both REC Defenders and K-wings lack hyperdrives, intending to serve in garrison forces or as part of large fleet groups where they can be berthed on capital vessels. This shows a shift away from the Rebel Alliance focus on raid-capable snubs as the New Republic attempts to produce a more coherent structure for newer fleets and defence forces.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAY,Modernised corvette group designed to engage smaller Imperial forces or pirate groups. The mobility of this force was capable of either holding out long enough for reinforcements to arrive or escape to report on more significant threats.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_AAZ,Kuat designed ships continued to be prevalent within naval doctrine. With improvements made to the Dominator style Interdictor Star Destroyer, the Mon Mothma class was put into production. Older Imperial Star Destroyers were utilised alongside newly produced ISDs as an escort for the new interdictor battleships, in similar task forces as used by the Empire.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_ABA,The backbone of the New Republic’s New Class Modernization Project, the Nebula Star Destroyers and the carrier Endurance Star Destroyers were able to engage significant threats at range and also provide powerful fighter and bomber support.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_ABB,Built on the same basic hull pattern, the combat-focussed Majestic and carrier-focussed Defender are early members of the New Class Modernization Project. Primarily intended for firepower and carrying capacity respectively, the group is able to effectively fight larger opponents with long-range weapons and bomber strikes while keeping itself protected from smaller vessels attempting to close range.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_ABC,Comprising of mobile, hard-hitting, but fragile capital warships, this task force is intended to seek out and rapidly destroy any Imperial threat before it could react. Fast task forces such as this would often be responsible both for local rapid response operations and raids on Imperial facilities or convoys. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_ABD,The New Republic made extensive use of Mon Calamari shipyards and designs. The MC80B was the first major success they had as a dedicated warship design, and the MC90 was an ultimate refinement of that within the doctrine of more compact designs. This task force was designed to respond to large threats from Imperial and Warlord forces, providing a sense of relief and hope to beleaguered and oppressed humans and non-humans alike.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_ABE,A battle group designed and used to great effect against Warlord Zsinj, this early New Republic fleet is well suited to taking on significant Imperial fleets as well as more eclectic Warlord forces.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_ABF,The Mon Calamari comprised a major part of the Rebellion and New Republic Navy with them mass producing ships in all size ranges to the point task forces and even fleets composed of just Mon Calamari designs were a common occurrence especially around Mon Calamari itself. While the war often forced fleets to be dispersed into many task forces operating across many planets, they could concentrate around their flagship in times of need to form an extremely formidable collection of Mon Calamari warships. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_ABG,While the new SoruSuub Bulwark III is derived from earlier TransGalMeg Bulwark models, the new sizable ship provided the New Republic with a powerful battlecruiser that when supported with other SoruSuub ships proved to be a deadly assault force, capable of going toe-to-toe with equally fearsome Imperial fleets.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_ABH,Despite originally having their start with warship design with the outbreak of the Rebellion, Mon Calamari would become a major warship supplier for the New Republic and would also enter into partnerships with other shipyards such as Rendili. As the Galactic Civil War dragged on, both Mon Calamari and Rendili would produce ever more deadly and capable warships for NR service. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_NR_ABI,The MC30 line of warships were highly mobile and packed large amounts of fire power especially for Mon Calamari designs. The A version was packed with turbolasers while the C version of the lineage focused on delivering large amounts of proton torpedoes on target in a short amount of time. Groups composed of these warships would rapidly become the bane of Imperial convoys and isolated ships during the Rebellion and Galactic Civil war as these groups could easily destroy or flee from anything the Imperials could muster. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAA,The Pentastar Alignment tended to stay isolationist. But that didn’t mean they were defenceless. Basic fighter squadrons could patrol and radio back for more advanced reinforcements if they encountered pirate, rebel, or rival raiding parties.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAB,In order to maintain control over agitated local populations. PA fighter command assigned units designed to strike at both hard and soft targets on the ground. These units were also capable of attacking hard targets in fleet combat, providing deadly payloads to both enemy strike craft and larger ships.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAC,Pentastar Alignment Fighter Command needed to put pilots up in space to fill any holes in their fleet engagements. For this purpose they turned to older, less popular TIE models, such as the TIE X3.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAD,The use of corvettes to support their larger ships proved crucial to the success of the Pentastar Alignment in maintaining control over their borders. The Raider could suppress enemy strike craft and bombers while the Adz was capable of hunting down and disabling enemy corvettes and smaller frigates.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAE,The Alignment’s focus on fighter superiority required the use of many carriers. One of the most readily available was the Ton Falk, able to rapidly deploy multiple squadrons to any engagement and provide light fire support. In order to help defend the vulnerable carrier, Pentastar Alignment deployed the Trenchant to act as a screening unit.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAF,Victory II Frigates proved highly effective at providing powerful fire support in major fleet engagements, as well as for chasing down fleeing corvettes. In order to protect the somewhat fragile warship from enemy bombers, Pentastar command deployed VT-49 gunships to provide cover and screening.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAG,An autonomous independent commando formation which did not align themselves to any single warlord post Endor. Instead they remained loyal to their original mission of hunting down the Rebellion wherever they could with covert operations. Despite no loyalty to a warlord, they were willing to assist them if their interests align. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAH,TIE Defenders proved effective in the hands of a good pilot against strong resistance, especially when supported with TIE X2s to flush out enemy interceptors.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAI,In order to secure their territory from surprise attacks, the Alignment needed to post patrol units in the most obscure lanes into their territory, the plentiful DHC and its offshoot, the Battle Horn, proved cheap, but viable to deploy.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAJ,Pairing the older, but still viable Acclamator heavy missile variant with the more modern Enforcer Picket ship proved highly effective in battering down heavily shielded and armoured targets.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAK,The Banking Clan provided the Pentastar Alignment access to their old communications ship design, the Munificent, bolstered by an up-gunned Corellian style corvette as an escort.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAL,TIE Bombers were always a mainstay of Imperial fleets, and modernized Skipray squadrons provided excellent screens that could also contribute to an assault on larger enemy ships.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAM,The Venator had always been a powerful multi-role carrier, but in the modern era’s order of battle has a heavier focus on raw firepower, the Venator needed support. The Procursator proved capable of providing both fire support and defence for the Venator.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAN,Tartan Patrol Cruisers proved very effective against all strike craft, and the Alignment chose to pair it with some of their more advanced fighter squadrons which were effective at drawing the strike craft into easily targeted dogfights
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAO,In order to capitalise on fighter superiority and to support the capital ships and frigates in the fleet. Pentastar Fighter Command put together a wing of their heaviest bombers to saturate the enemy fleet in heavy ordnance.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAP,The Imperial Star Destroyer was the symbol of the Empire, and ultimately proved effective as a warship design long after the fracturing of the Empire. Its multi-role capabilities allowed it to flexibly be deployed in a number of situations. The sister design of the ISD, Tector, had more specialised capability, sacrificing an external hangar bay for increased armour. Paired together, these ships covered most roles efficiently.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAQ,The Secutor was initially developed to act more independently than the Venator like the ISD. However grouping the two ships together provided both significant firepower and a very large pool of fighters and bombers to deploy.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAR,The Praetor Carrier sacrificed some of the firepower of the formidable Praetor-II battlecruiser for a massive amount of large hangars at the nose of the vessel for rapid deployment. Paired with the Secutor and Venator, this group could be deployed to any theatre of war in order to rapidly assume fighter dominance.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_PA_AAS,Both the Praetor Carrier and the Tagge Battlecruiser are known for having solid firepower and large carrying capacity for fighters and bombers. Since this fits Pentastar Alignment’s warfare doctrines so well, TaggeCo sold the corporate conglomerate several of their signature warships.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAA,In the Outer Rim access to TIE Fighters was not always reliable and thus Zsinj often had to turn to other designs of fighter to fulfil needed roles. The old but ever present Headhunter was often used as a garrison fighter as it was still good enough despite its age. Howlrunner was effectively an upgraded but more expensive TIE Fighter and through his contacts with the Incom Corporation before its defection Zsinj secured a reliable supply to supplement the garrisons of worlds with a more capable fighter. TIE bombers remained a necessity due their ability to hit larger warships that was lacking in the other fighters. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAB,With the development of the TIE Raptor, Warlord Zsinj decided to pair them with standard TIE Fighters. This proved to be effective, the TIE Fighters would flush out and tie down enemy fighters while the Raptors were free to chase bombers and circle back around to clean up the dogfights the TIE Fighters were in.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAC,Planets in the Outer Rim often had to source their PDF fighters from unconventional sources which saw less popular fighters being adopted in large numbers. When these planets came under control of Zsinj these fighters would remain as garrisons on the back waters and low priority areas where it was not expected they would have to deal with modern threats but just pirates and local unrest. However whenever the tides of war reached these planets or their local areas they would still be called upon to fight even against more modern and capable foes. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAD,In order to counter the New Republic’s usual tactics revolving around fighter superiority, corvette groups were used to patrol the fringes of his space. The CR90s could handle small groups of fighters and bombers while the CR92 could deal with any escorting enemy corvettes, and the YZ-775s were able to assist as needed depending on the engagement.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAE,With the breakup of the main Imperial fleets into squabbling factions, ships that would often be kept apart due to different branches and sector fleet use now find themselves pressed together to consolidate territory for assorted warlords. Fancy coreward support ships and skeletal convoy escorts both serve as effective fleet escorts or skirmishers against other small craft.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAF,Seeing the successes of the Nebulon-B Frigate and surveyor partnerships, Zsinj reached out to KDY to acquire the successor design of the Nebulon. The Corona Frigate rapidly provided itself to be a massive upgrade as a patrol frigate and for fleet escort duty. Paired with the capable Surveyor this was a highly capable frigate task force. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAG,Zsinj maintained a vast network of pirates and criminals who operated within the galaxy who respected Zsinj enough to trust that he would honour the contract and not betray them. He called upon them frequently to do odd jobs aimed to hurt his enemies or supply information. It is no coincidence that those who became Zsinj’s enemies would face a sudden increase in pirate raids which are surprisingly well supplied. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAH,An autonomous independent commando formation which did not align themselves to any single warlord post Endor. Instead they remained loyal to their original mission of hunting down the Rebellion wherever they could with covert operations. Despite no loyalty to a warlord, they were willing to assist them if their interests align.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAI,Despite Zsinj being friends with lots of pirate groups, there was still massive threats to his logistical chains due to New Republic raids. This forced fleet tenders and supply runs to have heavy escorts. Although the scale of his empire and the amount of fronts Zsinj had to fight on meant those escorts were often second line ships like the purpose built Neutron Star Bulk Cruiser and the later Adz as purpose built warships often already had too many demands placed on them.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAJ,Zsinj rapidly expanded his empire after the death of Palpatine which brought him into contact with several smaller warlords and other groups who submitted to his strength. These vassal groups would have to provide military forces to Zsinj’s Empire which resulted in eclectic task groups of non standard Imperial vessels being used.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAK,Attacks from fighters and other small craft increased in threat over the course of the Galactic Civil War. While lacking speed, Lancers could put up a substantial wall of laser fire at any oncoming threat which made it good at protecting static installations or slow moving convoys. TIE Aggressors could be deployed in support where they could chase down threats which tried to evade the Lancers or herd them into the fire of the lancers. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAL,The TIE Raptor was the premiere fighter for the Zsinj Empire and thus they tend to be concentrated on the most important areas. Sometimes Skiprays were used to bolster wings of TIE Raptors with additional firepower. They also provide a platform far more resilient to damage which could draw enemy fire away from the raptors thus giving the Raptors far better opportunities to attack. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAM,The VSD was a capable design which was capable of destroying most frigates and cruisers in battle. It however lacked proper defences against fighters apart from its own small fighter group. In reaction to this weakness corvettes and frigates often were tasked to escort the Victory while they were on mission.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAN,Zsinj’s non Imperial contacts ranged in size and power. Some were tiny bands of pirates with only a few fighters to their name. Others were pirate and criminal lords who commanded small fleets of their own. Some of their ships were refits of civilian vessels but some rare vessels in these fleets were actual warships like the Space Arc. Zsinj can call on these friends to support his efforts when in need. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAO,Imperial Star Destroyers were multirole capital ships which were sent on a wide variety of missions from fleet battles to ground invasions. Sometimes even sent on escort to protect more specialised or more important vessels. Aggressors with their massive long range guns were capable of devastating targets at long range or which were too slow to evade their shots. However they were vulnerable to small or fast moving vessels or being swarmed by fighters. ISDs can provide cover for the Aggressors as well as closing on and destroying vessels which have been crippled by the Aggressors.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAP,The Imperial Star Destroyer II was an upgrade of the base design to increase its firepower against other large ships. A single ISD is a formidable threat to any single vessel that does not significantly outsize it. Groups of ISDs with supporting Victory II Star Destroyers were a threat to nearly anything. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAQ,TIE Heavy Bombers could bring far more ordinance to bare on a target than the main line TIE Bomber and thus are deployed whenever possible against major threats. However they were fragile when under enemy fire and easy prey for any enemy fighters. In order to protect them the bombers were often given heavy fighter escorts. The turrets on the TIE Aggressors made them perfect for such escort duty as they could maintain formation while firing on enemies while just as capable in the dogfight as the regular TIE Fighter. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAR,A rare ship in the Empire, The Sorannan would see most of its service life sitting at major fleet bases awaiting a major crisis which was worth deploying it too. When it was deployed they were always given a substantial escort to keep the valuable asset safe as well as supplementing its capabilities. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_ZSINJ_AAS,Zsinj’s empire dominated the Corporate Sector Authority which was forced to supply Zsinj with resources and combat vessels as tribute. The House of Tagge would also supply their own Tagge Battlecruisers to Zsinj in order to court favour from the warlord. This battlecruiser would link up with Imperial Star Destroyers to form a heavy task force.

TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_CSA_CORPORATE_FOCUS,The Board only cares about profit. You are fighting here only to protect the profits of the board although a smart commander can always find a way to turn war into money. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_CSA_CUTTING_CORNERS,A recent commission has found many inefficiencies in our military procurement procedures. Ships could be constructed so much faster and cheaper if excessive safety standards were bypassed. The savings this brings will easily make a noticeable benefit to our profit. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_EOTH_ENHANCED_MOBILITY,A key requirement for controlling the pace of a battle is speed. It is possible to upgrade and fine tune our existing engines to increase their performance aiding our ships in closing with the enemy and disengaging at will.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_EOTH_SKIRMISH_TACTICS,The Empire of Hand doctrinally dislikes stand up slugging battles but prefers to use fast ships to control the pace of the battle. Further embrace this doctrine by sacrificing hull protection to boost the shield strength of EOTH ships increasing their effectiveness in hit and run tactics. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_ERIADU_EXPERIMENTAL_FOCUS,The Leadership of the Eriadu Authority has a bad habit of overestimating the capabilities of our ships leading to suicidal offensives. We could rapidly refit our ships to get some extra firepower out of them to help our ships match the leadership's expectations but this will come at the expense of the shielding. It's not like those deluded fools will notice.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_ERIADU_RECKLESS,Outlasting the enemy is a tactic for the weak and cowardly. True strength is destroying the enemy in battle. By reducing safety features on our ships we can increase their damage output allowing us to destroy the enemy before those cowards run away.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_HAPES_AGGRESSIVE_ISOLATIONISM,For millennia the Hapes Consortium have maintained an isolationist approach to the entirety of the galaxy and enforced that isolation via force. Be it smugglers lured by the tales of rich worlds or external powers trying to force the cluster to open up, the Navy of the Hapes Consortium aggressively hunts down and destroys all those who enter the Cluster without permission. Bringing in ship crews with real combat experience will help ensure the rapid destruction of the enemies of the Hapes Consortium.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_HAPES_NR_TECH_EXCHANGE,When galactic events forced the Hapes Consortium to open up and interact more with the galactic community, it created opportunities to compare Hapan technologies with those of the wider galaxy. The New Republic has been a bountiful source of technological improvements for the Hapes Consortium. Thanks to this influx of tech and new design practices, Hapan shielding capabilities have massively improved although it takes time and credits to roll these improvements out to the entirety of the Fleet. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_HUTT_CARTELS_BOOTANA_HUTTA_REINFORCEMENT,In the ancient past the Hutts used to be the overlords of an expansionist Empire but the devastation of many wars such as the Xim Wars and the later Hutt Cataclysm caused the Hutts to change their philosophy away from wars of conquests with slave armies towards soft power and subversion of others. While the contemporary Hutts outwardly seem relatively peaceful and passive, the Hutts still maintain a secret military on the Core Worlds with the Bootana Hutta Fleet being a strong mobile force ready to crush any unwanted attention aimed at their Core Worlds. If the Hutts ever decide to “wake up” and return to the aggression of old, this fleet could also form the core of a revitalised Hutt Navy.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_HUTT_CARTELS_PROFIT_MOTIVE,The Hutts are always mindful to find ways to defend or even increase their power and the Hutts have developed a preference to leveraging their economic strength instead of more mindless destructive displays of strength. Overseers squeeze out every inch of profit possible from the economic endeavours under their control while Commanders are careful with the deployment of military forces in order to conserve their strength over the long run to avoid the anger of their Hutt lords at any undue losses and the costs thus incurred in their replacement. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_IR_PONDERING_GIANT,The Empire focuses on bringing overwhelming firepower against any opposition. While this is useful in stand up battles, it can leave them slow to react to threats. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_IR_SUPERWEAPON_DESIRES,The Empire ruled through fear and displays of strength as shown by their many superweapon projects. While not exactly a traditional superweapon, establishing a Hyper Velocity Gun in range of the current battle will help tip the balance in our favour. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_MALROOD_CONSTANT_RAIDS,The doctrine of using smaller ships for offensive action gave the Teradoc brothers much greater tactical and strategic mobility over their opponents, massing forces against enemy weaknesses.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_MALROOD_THE_CRIMSON_FLEET,The Teradoc brothers inherited the Crimson fleet, a group of VSDs made from red armour. This large force of older, smaller ships was frequently used en masse for offensive action which differentiated the Teradocs from the other Imperial warlords who frequently relied on large ships. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_NR_FIGHTER_SUPREMACY,The New Republic has a long standing history of their pilots turning the tide of battle. Make sure our strike craft have the most modern upgrades to ensure their best performance and allow our pilots to continue their tradition of heroics.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_NR_MON_CALAMARI_SHIELDING,When the Mon Calamari joined the rebellion they had to refit civilian vessels into military use. To compensate for the weakness of the hulls, the Mon Calamari invested heavily into shield generators to provide combat sustainability. Ensure our ships have the best shielding possible to aid in their survival.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_PA_CORPORATE_ALLIES,The Pentastar was formed with local corporations as a key part of the government. Their generous donations allow for greater funding of the military than before. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_PA_ISOLATIONISM,The Pentastar was never bothered with expansionism or restoring the Empire to former strength. Instead the Pentastar focused on protecting the territory under their control and thus outlasting the opposition. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_ZSINJ_FRIENDS_IN_LOW_PLACES,Zsinj had more than a few unsavoury connections and was never scared of using them. Allowing these friends to explore through the wreckage for valuables and salvage in return for a small commission from the profits will greatly help the Warlord.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_ZSINJ_WARLORDISM,Zsinj is the original warlord of the post-Palpatine galaxy and amassed so much strength that a coalition of the Imperial Remnant, New Republic, and Hapes Consortium formed to bring him down. Zsinj was never short of ISDs or other large capital ships to send against his enemies and he used those capital ships as the basis of his empire.
