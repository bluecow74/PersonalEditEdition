TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_NO_MASTER_WARNING,None dare claim Mastery of the Sith. The Order of the Sith Lords lies dormant, for now...
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_BANDON,Darth Bandon: My apprentice was a fool to challenge me.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_BASTILA_SITH,Bastila Shan: Weakling! I'll rend your flesh for this pathetic rebellion. I hope your replacement will prove more competent.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_GLOVOC,Darth Glovoc: The plots of my underlings spin as futilely as the fire rings of Fornax, baubles of wrath that fail to scorch the object of their purpose.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_JORAK_ULN,Jorak Uln: What?! Mutiny! Behave, student! I'll... that's it! Detention for you! Permanent detention!!
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_KALATOSH_ZAVROS,Kalatosh Zavros: A Sith after my own heart. Pity, we would have done great things together.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_MALAK,Darth Malak: Such ambition, but without the strength to back it up. Perhaps my next apprentice will be more promising.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_NIHILUS,Darth Nihilus: [Ravenous screams]
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_REVAN_SITH,Darth Revan: The apprentice has learned their final lesson.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_SION,Darth Sion: I will remake you. So when I look upon you it shall be like a mirror. Then I shall let you die.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_TRAYA,Darth Traya: My overeager apprentice's treachery was no match for the Lord of Betrayal. I now seek a new and wiser student.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_UTHAR_WYNN,Uthar Wynn: You have become too ambitious, apprentice. It is time for you to die and someone more... talented... to take your place.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_VOREN_RENSTAAL,Darth Voren: You may have matched my own ambition, but I refuse to let go of what I fought for so easily. Now, perish!
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_RETAINED_YUTHURA,Yuthura Ban: There's no such thing as friends among the Sith. It's time for you to die.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_SYSTEM,The Sith leadership is composed of powerful force users, at the master, apprentice, and acolyte level. Typically one Master, one Apprentice, and two Acolytes. If any are killed, a new one may be chosen from the available pool. As time goes on, the apprentice's ambition also grows, and a leader has to be chosen between the Master and Apprentice, killing the loser.

TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_BASTILA_SITH,Bastila Shan: I learned much from you, but I'm afraid I have no need of you now. Is it not our way for the apprentice to surpass the master?
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_GLOVOC,Darth Glovoc: I have seen the trammels that shall bind the galaxy utterly. Trammels I saw myself place, that I shall lay down as my visions bid.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_JORAK_ULN,Jorak Uln: You were a fool to let down your guard, and what kind of Sith would I be if I didn't grab fate by the nose hairs? Ha ha!
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_KALATOSH_ZAVROS,Kalatosh Zavros: You still haven't come to terms with the wickedness of your ways, master? So be it. You will die.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_MALAK,Darth Malak: The strongest must rule this galaxy, and you are far too weak to rule any longer. The Sith throne is mine!
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_NIHILUS,Darth Nihilus: [Distorted howls of hunger]
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_REVAN_SITH,Darth Revan: I am the Lord of the Sith! Bow down before me!
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_SION,Darth Sion: To not seize power when it lies before you is weakness. The chance to heal this fractured galaxy, to make it strong, now lies with me.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_TRAYA,Darth Traya: It can be a quiet thing, for the tide of history to turn upon one who was so strong. But now it is I who holds the galaxy by its throat.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_UTHAR_WYNN,Uthar Wynn: To stand still is to know death... one must always be moving forward. So is it the same amongst the Sith. Compete or die.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_VOREN_RENSTAAL,Darth Voren: Where once I was merely the learner, now I am the master. Neither Jedi nor Sith shall stand above me again!
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TAKEOVER_YUTHURA,Yuthura Ban: Do you hear that, my master? That is the sound of a new leader rising to replace you.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TRAYA_APPROACH,Darth Traya: Even now, events spiral towards destruction, though something may yet be done if you will simply listen, and understand. Revan knew this better than anyone. I shall wait until you choose to follow this path. When you are ready you have but to ask, and I will answer.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TRIUMVIRATE_END_NIHILUS_AND_SION,Darth Sion: No longer shall we be constrained by teachings that weaken us. Your rule is at an end, master. And with it the end of the Jedi is at hand.
TEXT_GOVERNMENT_RULEOFTWO_TRIUMVIRATE_END_TRAYA,Darth Traya: You've failed to learn the lesson I sought to teach - that your strength is as meaningless as the strength of my hand. I have no need for such broken tools any longer.

TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESGROUND_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Mandalorian Rally Master:  We conquer planets quicker than our war forges can keep up with. Hahaha! Cassus Fett always babbled about... What's the basic word again? Ah right, logistics! And that we need to account more for it. So do that!
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESGROUND_MANDO_SPEECH_02,Mandalorian Rally Master:  That should work, soldier. You are a vital part of the Mando'ade!
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESGROUND_MANDO_SPEECH_03,Mandalorian Rally Master:  You idiot! Can't you even do a simple task right? I can't believe Manda'lor would even trust you with anything!
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESGROUND_REP_SPEECH_01,Republic Senator:  The Delegation for Local Development has petitioned the Senate for expanded surface facilities in various member systems. You are instructed to make investments accordingly.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESGROUND_REP_SPEECH_02,Republic Senator:  The Senate thanks you. Your wise investments have created badly-needed jobs in several member systems.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESGROUND_REP_SPEECH_03,Republic Senator:  The Delegation has informed me that its members will not be supporting the military appropriations bill scheduled to be debated in the next session.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESGROUND_SITH_SPEECH_01,Sith Acolyte:  My masters have decided we must increase our production and for some reason see you as fit to accomplish the task. See that you don't fail us.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESGROUND_SITH_SPEECH_02,Sith Acolyte:  Against all odds it seems you have succeeded. This time.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESGROUND_SITH_SPEECH_03,Sith Acolyte:  You have failed your task, as I expected. Get out of my sight.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESSPACE_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Mandalorian Field Marshal: Despite what some of our brethren may think, our fleets do not build themselves. See to it that fresh spaceyards are being built and I can lend you resources from the clans under my authority.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESSPACE_MANDO_SPEECH_02,Mandalorian Field Marshal: Excellent, with this we'll be able to keep supplying fresh ships into our crusade. Vor entye.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESSPACE_MANDO_SPEECH_03,Mandalorian Field Marshal: Are you incapable of following the simplest instructions, Di'kut?
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESSPACE_REP_SPEECH_01,Republic Senator:  The Trade Promotion Working Group has reviewed our current planetary infrastructure and has concluded it is insufficient to support economic growth. You are instructed to make investments accordingly.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESSPACE_REP_SPEECH_02,Republic Senator:  The Senate thanks you. Your wise investments will help us collect tariffs from interstellar merchants.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESSPACE_REP_SPEECH_03,Republic Senator:  Some Senators in the Working Group are beginning to doubt your commitment to interstellar trade.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESSPACE_SITH_SPEECH_01,Sith Acolyte:  Our worlds require further subjugation. New orbital facilities would keep our subjects in check. Failure is not an option.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESSPACE_SITH_SPEECH_02,Sith Acolyte:  You have done well. Together, we could accomplish much...
TEXT_INTERVENTION_BUILDSTRUCTURESSPACE_SITH_SPEECH_03,Sith Acolyte:  A pathetic display.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREDITINCOME_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Mandalorian Quartermaster: Even the best Mandalorian warriors need to be compensated beyond a worthy battle sometimes. Stockpile your credits enough to show your wealth and power, and clans scattered throughout the galaxy will come lining up to fight for us.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREDITINCOME_MANDO_SPEECH_02,Mandalorian Quartermaster: You've accumulated quite a bit of wealth, and now we have fresh warriors lining up in hopes for their cut.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREDITINCOME_MANDO_SPEECH_03,Mandalorian Quartermaster: I hope those credits you've burnt through were worth it...
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREDITINCOME_REP_SPEECH_01,Republic Senator:  The budget office has projected a shortfall this quarter. We must plan accordingly and acquire the necessary credits to alleviate this.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREDITINCOME_REP_SPEECH_02,Republic Senator:  Excellent work, Commander. The Senate commends you on your frugality.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREDITINCOME_REP_SPEECH_03,Republic Senator:  Your failure to manage this budgetary problem has caused uproar in the Senate, and has cast doubt in your ability to lead the Galactic Republic.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREDITINCOME_SITH_SPEECH_01,Sith Acolyte:  Our reserves have been insufficient to cover the expanding needs of our fleet. Secure the finances we need, by any means necessary.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREDITINCOME_SITH_SPEECH_02,Sith Acolyte:  Good, good. Thanks to your efforts it's only a matter of time before our enemies fall before us.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREDITINCOME_SITH_SPEECH_03,Sith Acolyte:  In your position, I would be careful. Failures is not tolerated among the Sith.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREWINCOME_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Mandalorian Rally Master:  We need more 'recruits'. Do your part to 'acquire' them.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREWINCOME_MANDO_SPEECH_02,Mandalorian Rally Master:  The slaves should prove useful. Good work.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREWINCOME_MANDO_SPEECH_03,Mandalorian Rally Master:  Another failure... Why do I even bother with you?
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREWINCOME_REP_SPEECH_01,Republic Senator:  The Navy is in need of more manpower. Increase recruitment efforts at once.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREWINCOME_REP_SPEECH_02,Republic Senator:  You have done a great service to the Galactic Republic.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREWINCOME_REP_SPEECH_03,Republic Senator:  The Navy cannot operate our fleets with such deficiencies. Your performance is most unsatisfactory.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREWINCOME_SITH_SPEECH_01,Sith Acolyte:  Our fleet will not crew itself. We must increase enlistment, willing or otherwise.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREWINCOME_SITH_SPEECH_02,Sith Acolyte:  My master was apparently right to place his trust in you. 
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CREWINCOME_SITH_SPEECH_03,Sith Acolyte:  Yet another failure. Perhaps you should personally make up for this crew shortfall.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_HUNTTARGETA_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Mandalorian Rally Master:  Our Gogi report that these convoys transport high ranking enemy personnel. It would be a shame if said convoys were to suddenly... explode. Ha!
TEXT_INTERVENTION_HUNTTARGETA_MANDO_SPEECH_02,Mandalorian Rally Master:  You did your task well, soldier. Take these as a reward for your mission!
TEXT_INTERVENTION_HUNTTARGETA_MANDO_SPEECH_03,Mandalorian Rally Master:  If I ever meet you in person, expect a Beskar Kiss, you fool!
TEXT_INTERVENTION_HUNTTARGETA_REP_SPEECH_01,Republic Intelligence Officer:  We've tracked an enemy supply convoy close to the front lines. This is a chance to disrupt their supplies to the frontline.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_HUNTTARGETA_REP_SPEECH_02,Republic Intelligence Officer:  Good work, Commander. Keep this up and we'll starve the enemy armies into submission!
TEXT_INTERVENTION_HUNTTARGETA_REP_SPEECH_03,Republic Intelligence Officer:  Good men risked their lives to bring us the intel you just wasted! I hope you had a good reason.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_HUNTTARGETA_SITH_SPEECH_01,Sith Commander: A supply convoy of our rivals has been exposed by our spy networks. Ensure they never reach their destination.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_HUNTTARGETA_SITH_SPEECH_02,Sith Commander: Efficient and ruthless, as expected of a good Sith. You'll be well compensated for this.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_HUNTTARGETA_SITH_SPEECH_03,Sith Commander: You let an easy victory slip past you? You are worse than useless!
TEXT_INTERVENTION_INFILTRATION_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Mandalorian Scout: This targets promising, but it needs to be softened up if I hope to take acceptable casualties. Lend us your support and my clan will grant you ours.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_INFILTRATION_MANDO_SPEECH_02,Mandalorian Scout: You adhere to the Resol'nare well. We'll take everything of value there and meet with your forces after.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_INFILTRATION_MANDO_SPEECH_03,Mandalorian Scout: Ignoring a fellow Mandalorians call to arms? You are coward, dar'manda.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_INFILTRATION_REP_SPEECH_01,Republic Security Officer:  This hostile stronghold is too well defended for a direct assault. I propose we send a Commando Squad to help disable its defences.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_INFILTRATION_REP_SPEECH_02,Republic Security Officer:  Excellent work Commander. With their defences down, a local fleet can make easy work of any remaining forces.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_INFILTRATION_REP_SPEECH_03,Republic Security Officer:  Their defences are still operable! If the interests of the Senate cannot be fulfilled, they shall not support new legislation.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_INFILTRATION_SITH_SPEECH_01,Sith Assassin: This location is of interest to us, but it is dangerously fortified. If you sabotage their base it will enhance both our ambitions.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_INFILTRATION_SITH_SPEECH_02,Sith Assassin: You have made a wise choice. The assassins are ready to infiltrate the target.

TEXT_INTERVENTION_RAISE_INFLUENCE_MANDO_SPEECH_02,Mandalorian Rally Master: You've saved me a headache suppressing these complaints, and for that I am grateful. Take this as payment.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RAISE_INFLUENCE_MANDO_SPEECH_03,Mandalorian Rally Master: What a mess, now we'll need to perform some public executions to keep order. Thanks for nothing.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RAISE_INFLUENCE_SITH_SPEECH_01,Sith Governor: This planet has become unruly lately, which is unacceptable. Ensure order is enforced or I will have to deal with this personally.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RAISE_INFLUENCE_SITH_SPEECH_02,Sith Governor: Excellent, the inhabitants have learned their duty is to serve the Sith.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RAISE_INFLUENCE_SITH_SPEECH_03,Sith Governor: It looks like I will have to deal with this myself. Worthless scum...
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RAISEINFRASTRUCTURE_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Mandalorian Rally Master: I have no interest in such petty things as 'logistics' but our Field Marshal desires this planets infrastructure be built up. A waste of time if you ask me...
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RAISEINFRASTRUCTURE_MANDO_SPEECH_02,Mandalorian Rally Master:  I assume you did a good job? Actually, I don't care, just take your reward and go. We should task our slaves and not bother ourselves with these things.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RAISEINFRASTRUCTURE_MANDO_SPEECH_03,Mandalorian Rally Master:  I knew Mandalorians shouldn't care for these things. It's beneath us so I understand why you didn't bother with it. Unfortunately the Field Marshal is unhappy and is withheld support for you.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RAISEINFRASTRUCTURE_REP_SPEECH_01,Republic Senator:  This war has impacted the Galactic Republic's administrative capabilities. Reach these quotas and we will return to optimal levels.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RAISEINFRASTRUCTURE_REP_SPEECH_02,Republic Senator:  The Senate thanks you, you have stabilised the Galactic Republic sufficiently.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RAISEINFRASTRUCTURE_REP_SPEECH_03,Republic Senator:  The stability of the Senate is now compromised further. We shall reprimand your decision at the next Senatorial meeting.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RAISEINFRASTRUCTURE_SITH_SPEECH_01,Sith Governor: Our empire's resource base isn't being exploited properly. Construct additional buildings so that we may reap the spoils of our wars more efficiently.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RAISEINFRASTRUCTURE_SITH_SPEECH_02,Sith Governor: Civil investments may not be of the dark side, but stable industry is beneficial to the Sith Empire all the same. You have done well.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RAISEINFRASTRUCTURE_SITH_SPEECH_03,Sith Governor: Incompetent lout! I'll see you replaced in time...
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RECON_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Mandalorian Rally Master:  Our Gogi have reported something on this world. We don't know what it is but it might be worth investigating further.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RECON_MANDO_SPEECH_02,Mandalorian Rally Master:  An impressive find! These things will prove vital for our coming campaigns.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RECON_MANDO_SPEECH_03,Mandalorian Rally Master:  How little authority can someone have if they can't even command a recon mission? You should be scrubbing the floors on a Kyramud instead of commanding!
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RECON_REP_SPEECH_01,Republic Intelligence Officer:  Galactic Republic Intelligence has requested surveillance efforts on these worlds. Successful reconnaissance will aid us greatly.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RECON_REP_SPEECH_02,Republic Intelligence Officer:  Thank you, Commander. We have gained useful intelligence from this.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RECON_REP_SPEECH_03,Republic Intelligence Officer:  The failure of this task does not give the Galactic Republic reassurance of your abilities.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RECON_SITH_SPEECH_01,Sith Assassin: Our master desires us to infiltrate these planets. If you survey them for us they have offered compensation.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_RECON_SITH_SPEECH_02,Sith Assassin: The master is most pleased, and has offered you some of his personal weapons stockpile.

TEXT_INTERVENTION_SENATOR_RESCUE_REP_SPEECH_01,Republic Senator:  A member of the Senate has been captured by hostile forces. Send a Commando Squad and rescue him.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_SENATOR_RESCUE_REP_SPEECH_02,Republic Senator:  Excellent work Commander, the Senate commends you on your frugality.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_SENATOR_RESCUE_REP_SPEECH_03,Republic Senator:  This won't make a good impression to the Senate.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_SENATOR_RESCUE_SITH_SPEECH_01,Sith Acolyte: A high-ranking member of the military has been captured. Extract them before they can expose our security apparatus.

TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETANY_MANDO_SPEECH_02,Mandalorian Rally Master:  I will begin with the 'recruitment' immediately, hahahah!
TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETANY_MANDO_SPEECH_03,Mandalorian Rally Master:  With more failures like you in our ranks, the Mando'ade is doomed.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETANY_REP_SPEECH_01,Republic Security Officer:  We cannot allow the spread of anti-Republic ideologies, thus, High Command has prioritised the military occupation of this world.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETANY_REP_SPEECH_02,Republic Security Officer:  Good work, Commander. With this, the Galactic Republic is safe from any hostile incursions taking root here.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETANY_REP_SPEECH_03,Republic Security Officer:  This is unacceptable, Commander! You have allowed these hostile scum to go unchecked for too long.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETANY_SITH_SPEECH_01,Sith Acolyte: The leaders of this world think they do not have to fear the Sith. Show them how wrong they are.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETANY_SITH_SPEECH_02,Sith Acolyte: Excellent work. A public execution of their former leaders will mark the last chapter of this pitiful defiance.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETANY_SITH_SPEECH_03,Sith Acolyte: Pathetic, is this what passes for leadership amongst the Sith now?
TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETENEMY_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Mandalorian Rally Master:  We need more rally camps and war forges and for that we need more slaves. Conquering this world should solve both problems.

TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETENEMY_REP_SPEECH_01,Republic Security Officer:  It has come to our attention that this planet has become increasingly dissatisfied with its current leaders. Send forces to prop up a new regime that is loyal to the Galactic Republic.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETENEMY_REP_SPEECH_02,Republic Security Officer:  Well done, Commander. The newly installed government will greatly benefit the Galactic Republic.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETENEMY_REP_SPEECH_03,Republic Security Officer:  We are most displeased with your failure, Commander. The Galactic Republic has no choice but to deny your additional units.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETENEMY_SITH_SPEECH_01,Sith Master: Dissatisfaction has been reported between portions of this planets government. Prepare a task force to 'assist' whichever side is most amenable to the Sith.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_TAKEPLANETENEMY_SITH_SPEECH_02,Sith Master: Most satisfactory. We will of course continue our presence there as a sign of support to the new government, hehehehehe...

TEXT_INTERVENTION_UNIT_HUNT_MANDO_SPEECH_03,Mandalorian Rally Master:  Idiot.

TEXT_INTERVENTION_UNIT_HUNT_REP_SPEECH_02,Republic Intelligence Officer:  You've struck a great blow to the enemy, Commander, well done.

TEXT_INTERVENTION_UNIT_HUNT_SITH_SPEECH_01,Sith Commander: My superiors are demanding greater casualties inflicted on the enemy, and this target looks like exactly what I need. Crush them, and we may both get out of this with our heads on our shoulders.

TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_01,Vandar:  Sometimes I wonder if this is what the force wants. Does it want for us to become one with it?
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_02,-- How can someone believe in the good of the galaxy when horrors are engulfing it every second. Did the force desert us?
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_03,Dorak:  You once said to me that every dawn is preceded by a night. -- No matter how dark, it only takes one candle to drive it away.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_04,This is not the end, my friend.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_05,Vandar:  Mhm, you might be right. The Republic will fall today, but its ideals will carry on.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_06,-- And we will have a lifetime to repay our debt to the galaxy and the Republic.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_07,Dorak:  Indeed... Ironic, isn't it? In the end the Covernant and its watchers were so focused on the Sith
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_08,their visions never revealed the true extensions of the Mandalorian threat.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_09,Vandar:  Ever since Knight Carrick has uncovered the conspiracy
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_10,I wondered how much Kryndaa's followers were but a microcosm of what the Jedi had become.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_11,Dorak:  A depressing thought... If we hadn't been blinded by our fear of the Sith, we'd noticed the threat in front of us.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_12,I supposed in the end, we are always smarter.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUMBLING_CAPITAL_SPEECH_13,Vandar:  We trusted our instincts, but no one can always be right. The lesson is to learn from our mistakes.

TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_04,is a disgrace to my forebearers who gave their lives purging the galaxy of your kind.

TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_06,Hear my words, animal! I have a message for your people.
TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_07,Years ago your kin repelled the assaults of my predecessor.

TEXT_MISSION_CRUSHING_CATHAR_SPEECH_17,Cassus Fett:  The Cathar left a stain of dishonor on the Mando'ade. Today, I wash it clean in the water of their own presumption.

TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_MANDO_SPEECH_27,The Republic calls you rogue, yet they don't see that you have found the way of Mand'alor even if you still deny it.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_MANDO_SPEECH_28,I will enjoy killing you, for you are worthy of my axe.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_MANDO_SPEECH_29,For death and victory!
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_MANDO_SPEECH_30,Mandalore the Ultimate:  Revan is no fool. Whatever the plan is, it is linked to that station. See to its destruction at once.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_MANDO_SPEECH_31,Mandalore the Ultimate:  Status update! What was that?
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_MANDO_SPEECH_32,Canderous Ordo:  More forces have entered the system. It is Revan.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_MANDO_SPEECH_33,Mandalore the Ultimate:  It is time for the Revanchist to become with their so-called force once and for all.

TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_06,Bao-Dur:  I am sorry, General. The Supreme Commander has made it clear that in these final stages
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_07,we can't allow any mistakes to happen. This is why any communicatons out of the system until the final go are prohibited as well.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_08,Vengen:  I figured, but this is also why I am here.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_09,Revan gave the green light for 'Operation: Force Grip' twelve hours ago.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_10,Our fleet is currently painting the biggest target known to the galaxy on its back.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_11,If everything goes as planned, the enemy fleet will enter this system in three days.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_12,Bao-Dur:  And if not? What if Mandalore and his dogs won't come? We left so many worlds undefended for this trap.....
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_13,Vengen:  Mandalorians are animals. The prospect of fighting Revan in a single glorious battle will 
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_14,be enough for hopefully the entire rim armada to crawl out of their holes towards their execution.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_15,Bao-Dur:  Very well. Prepare for boarding, General.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_16,Bao-Dur:  Multiple hostile ships have entered the system, General.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_17,They bear the markings of the Beskar Armada. We have visual confirmation of Mand'alor's flagship.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_18,Meetra Surik:  Open a channel to the Supreme Commander. Report that the trap worked.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_19,We need the Sword Armada to block the Mandalorian retreat vector.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_20,Bao-Dur:  Revan's flagship says that its forces are currently being delayed by a vanguard party.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_21,We are instructed to commence the countdown and activate the weapon. Sword Armada will join us as soon as she can.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_22,Meetra Surik:  Very well. Form a perimeter around the generator.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_23,We will hold the line until it is online. No one shall pass.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_24,Bao-Dur:  The station is lost. The plan failed.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_25,Meetra Surik:  Maybe but Phase Two can still be successful. Send Revan the coordinates of Mand'alor's ship.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_26,Revan:  Surviving forces, this is Revan speaking. We suffered severe losses but the snake's head still lives.
TEXT_MISSION_MALACHOR_MASSACRE_REP_SPEECH_27,Every ship still capable of fighting will rally behind me. We will end this tonight.

TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_02,I can hear its wisper, like a soundless melody coming from the jungle and beyond.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_03,Galia Kira:  The darkness has always engulfed Onderon. -- You are wise to fear it, young padawan.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_04,Its poisonouns veins run deep through the jungle and its rivers.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_05,Tolaris Shim:  The Queen is right, Voren. -- What you feel is the consequence of the planet's dark past.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_06,Let this be a lesson that the dark path is never far for a Jedi. Ignore it, and you risk running towards it.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_07,Oron Kira:  As melodramatic as always, old friend. -- I sometimes wonder if this is a requirement for becoming a Jedi Master.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_08,Tolaris Shim:  Sometimes a breath of melodrama is the only way to reach a pupil.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_09,I am sure, you have learned this lesson with your daughter as well.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_10,Galia Kira:  Maybe... Talia did change in recent times. She has started to realise how important her role is and how much she can help the galaxy.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_11,She even gave up on her dream as a beast rider, despite it breaking her father's heart.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_12,Oron Kira:  Children... what can I say? You can try everything you want, but in the end they are more stubborn than Iziz's walls.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_13,At least my nephew is trying to learn the traditions of my side of the fam---

TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_16,Commander Vaklu:  No, sir. Mandalorians. Millions. The watchers are reporting a swarm of Basilisks coming out of the jungles.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_17,They are heading-- Sir! They breached the walls. Mandalorians are entering the city.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_18,Tolaris Shim:  It seems the Mandalorians found their way back to Onderon. We need to protect the city.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_19,Oron Kira:  We will. Galia, you must take our daughter and flee. Come back when we have defeated the attackers.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_20,But if the worst comes, I need to know you two are safe.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_21,Tolaris Shim:  Voren. Protect the queen at all cost. I will help the King defend the city.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_22,Mandalore the Ultimate:  It's been so long since I was last here. Hah! Time to settle accounts.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_23,Whoever brings me the King will get their own star system!
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_24,Oron Kira:  Monster, you will not get away with this!
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_25,The jungle will come for you soon enough. You can't outrun your destiny.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_26,Mandalore the Ultimate:  No one can. This is what brought me here.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_27,Even if I was just a mere soldier back then, I was impressed by the fiercefulness of your kind.
TEXT_MISSION_ONDERON_OCCUPATION_SPEECH_28,And I have to say, even now the fire in your spirit burns strong. You would have made a fine Mandalorian.

TEXT_MISSION_REKKIAD_RUNES_SPEECH_10,Mandalore:  Mandalorians should be making tombs, not breaking into them.
TEXT_MISSION_REKKIAD_RUNES_SPEECH_11,I struggle to see why you needed me for this.
TEXT_MISSION_REKKIAD_RUNES_SPEECH_12,Emissary:  A warrior of your skill is only a benefit on such unfamiliar terrain. And was it not your own choice to join me?
TEXT_MISSION_REKKIAD_RUNES_SPEECH_13,It was you who knew the importance of our meeting before I even made my case.

TEXT_MISSION_REKKIAD_RUNES_SPEECH_20,There are no treasures here! Just holocrons and journals.
TEXT_MISSION_REKKIAD_RUNES_SPEECH_21,Emissary:  You set your own expectations, my friend.

TEXT_STORY_CORE_ASSAULT_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Mandalore the Ultimate:  The last battles were just the beginning. What comes next will be the final nail in the Republic's coffin. The surviving defenders will no doubt retreat towards their remaining fortress worlds and dig themselves in.

TEXT_STORY_CORE_ASSAULT_MANDO_SPEECH_02,Vode An, my friend. Break any Republic stronghold but leave Coruscant for last. Every surviving Republic fleet should gather there. -- I want a battle that goes down in history!
TEXT_STORY_CORE_ASSAULT_MANDO_SPEECH_03,Cassus Fett:  I have to admit, now that the Core stands alone with the main Republic shipwrights in our hands, our production problems should be solvable.
TEXT_STORY_CORE_ASSAULT_MANDO_SPEECH_03_ALT,Cassus Fett:  I have to admit, now that the Core stands alone with the main Republic shipwrights in our hands, our production problems should be solvable.
TEXT_STORY_CORE_ASSAULT_MANDO_SPEECH_04,Yet, this is just half the rent. We have to start exploiting what we've taken. Especially if the boss' plan for Coruscant will work.

TEXT_STORY_CORE_ASSAULT_MANDO_SPEECH_12,Cassus Fett:  More and more Republic remnants are joining Revan's army. Our spies have tracked them towards... the haunted world of Malachor... 
TEXT_STORY_CORE_ASSAULT_MANDO_SPEECH_12_ALT,Mandalore the Ultimate:  The Republic is beaten! All hail the Mando'ade!
TEXT_STORY_CORE_ASSAULT_MANDO_SPEECH_13,Mandalore the Ultimate:  Malachor? What madness drives a man to that forsaken world. Very well. Rally our fleets, Cassus. We will crush Revan above Malachor!
TEXT_STORY_INTRO_PROGRESSIVE_MANDO_3957_START,Vipsanis: In spite of my efforts, my claim to the title of Manda'lor remains dubious without the pretender's mask. Warriors across the galaxy would rather live as bandits and mercenaries for the highest bidder because I lack it. Osik! A demonstration of leadership is in order to ensure the obedience of the clans still under us, and we shall start by reminding the Republic and the Sith we still endure.
TEXT_STORY_INTRO_PROGRESSIVE_MANDO_3959_START,Vipsanis: The usurper Manda'lor has fallen. I would rejoice if not for all the warriors he dragged to an early grave with him. Now because of that Sithspawn the clans are scattered across the galaxy. It is up to those with the strength and will to unite us once more, and with the Jedi and Sith now fighting amongst themselves we can repay our humiliation back tenfold!
TEXT_STORY_INTRO_PROGRESSIVE_MANDO_3962_START,Mandalore the Ultimate: The Republic falters at our advance, and with every victory we are ever closer to breaking down the halls of Coruscant itself. We only have to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down. Our frontline reports of further Jedi involvement under this supposed 'Revanchist' has caused some worry amongst the Rally Masters, but one foolish Jedi alone cannot stop us.
TEXT_STORY_INTRO_PROGRESSIVE_MANDO_3964_START,Mandalore the Ultimate: For years we have preyed on the edges of the Republic, testing our might and stockpiling weapons for our crusade. Now the real war begins. We shall break the Republic's defensive line around Taris, and carry that momentum down into the Core. The Neo-Crusaders shall be the bulwark of our invasion, bringing fresh recruits and slaves into our war machine with every conquest. Soon the galaxy shall learn to fear the Mandalorians once more!
TEXT_STORY_INTRO_PROGRESSIVE_REPUBLIC_3957_START,Supreme Chancellor Tol Cressa: The Republic is on the brink commander. Revan has brought us defeat after defeat, and even now with the Dark Lord dead the apprentice Malak has taken control of the Sith Empire. Malak is even more brutal than his master, and with the Sith armada growing stronger by the day, only the Jedi may be able to save us now.
TEXT_STORY_INTRO_PROGRESSIVE_REPUBLIC_3959_START,Supreme Chancellor Tol Cressa: This is a dark day for the Republic... One of our greatest heroes, Revan, has returned leading a new Sith Empire. If that was not enough some of our most decorated officers like Admiral Karath have defected over to him. Large swathes of the galaxy now lie under Sith control, and with Revan's genius now turned against the Republic we will need to muster everything we can to stop them. The Jedi Order have thankfully offered their assistance, and we will need them in the times ahead.
TEXT_STORY_INTRO_PROGRESSIVE_REPUBLIC_3962_START,Supreme Chancellor Tol Cressa: We are being pushed back at every turn, and the attack on Duro shows even the Core is not safe. Only the efforts of the Jedi Revan has prevented a complete rout. Meanwhile the Jedi Order refuses to offer any support, and I am growing displeased with their recalcitrance. Therefore by my authority as Supreme Chancellor, I decree Revan commander of the Republic's military forces. May the Force be with us all.
TEXT_STORY_INTRO_PROGRESSIVE_REPUBLIC_3964_START,Supreme Chancellor Tol Cressa: The Mandalorians have spent over a decade preying on worlds in the Outer Rim, and now they threaten Taris. The Senate has prioritized holding the region against any advance, so defend it to the best of your abilities. In addition, while the Jedi Order has decided to not involve themselves, a group of Jedi has shown interest in assisting the Army and Navy directly. While we do not get involved in the Order's politics, their help may be necessary at this juncture.
TEXT_STORY_INTRO_PROGRESSIVE_SITH_3957_START,Darth Malak: My old master was too weak to unite this fractured galaxy. I do not intend to repeat their mistakes, and with the full power of the Star Forge at my command, the Republic's Core Worlds will be broken under my armada! The Jedi Order are too weak to stop me, and soon even their most promising disciple shall be in my hands. Until then prepare yourself commander, lest you end up like your unfortunate predecessor.
TEXT_STORY_INTRO_PROGRESSIVE_SITH_3959_START,Darth Revan: I have fought and led in the greatest hells, yet I still seek what I always have; the conquest of my enemies. The Republic and Jedi have failed in their duty, and so they have become my enemies. Already old loyalists and fresh converts bolster our ranks, with more to come whether willingly or not. When the last dogs of the Republic are broken and kneeling at our feet, the triumph of the Sith will echo throughout the galaxy!
TEXT_STORY_INTRO_PROGRESSIVE_SITH_3962_START,Jorak Uln: The galaxy has torn itself apart in this gruesome war... oh how it warms my old heart! I can only imagine how it's affecting those poor innocent Jedi on the frontlines. The dark swirls so strongly around that Revan and their lackeys I can feel it all the way from Korriban! Perhaps we should reveal ourselves to the galaxy once more and begin... 'recruiting.'
TEXT_STORY_INTRO_PROGRESSIVE_SITH_3964_START,Jorak Uln: The Sith may have fallen on hard times since Master Kun's unfortunate demise, but we are nowhere near finished. And those barbaric Mandalorians starting another spat with the Republic gives us just the opportunity we need to reclaim our place at the top of the pecking order. The time for our great revenge on the Jedi has never been more ripe!
TEXT_STORY_JEDI_CIVIL_WAR_CRAWL_BODY_01,In the wake of a false peace, chaos descends upon the galaxy. The Jedi, once symbols of tranquility, find themselves entangled in a destructive conflict. A charismatic Jedi Knight, REVAN, had led the Republic against the Mandalorian threat, only to vanish mysteriously on a quest to the Unknown Regions.
TEXT_STORY_JEDI_CIVIL_WAR_CRAWL_BODY_02,Now, returned from exile, enveloped in a new and ominous ideology, the Revanchists wage war against the Republic they once vowed to protect. With Sith and former Republic soldiers as allies, Revan endeavors to reshape the galaxy according to a dark and unsettling vision.

TEXT_STORY_MANDALORIAN_ONSLAUGHT_CRAWL_BODY_01,The fringes of the Republic are ablaze. After years of terrorizing worlds beyond known space, Mandalorian forces led by the cunning CASSUS FETT turn their assault toward Republic-aligned planets. To defend their interests in the Outer Rim, the Republic Navy is forming a defensive belt around the vital ecumenopolis of Taris.
TEXT_STORY_MANDALORIAN_ONSLAUGHT_CRAWL_BODY_02,Meanwhile, the Jedi Order remains fractured, debating their role in the galaxy after the previous wars. Following an incident involving Padawan ZAYNE CARRICK, the Council has withdrawn from Taris, igniting unrest throughout the nearby systems.

TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_MAIN_SPEECH_02,Our scholars and seers believe, that the heart of the Sith Empire is the machine called the Star Forge, a Dark Side-fueled factory of seemingly limitless capacity left behind by an ancient civilization. Unfortunately, the location of it has been lost to time, but this mustn't stop us.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_MAIN_SPEECH_03,We have reason to believe that one of our own found this unknown world by combining fragments of ancient star maps scattered across worlds throughout the galaxy. If we retrace their steps, we too may discover the secret location of this Star Forge.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_PREATTACK_SPEECH_01,Jedi Master Vandar:  Well done commander, our scholars now have enough star map fragments to piece together the location of the Star Forge.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_PREATTACK_SPEECH_02,By the Force! The location of the Star Forge is deep within the Unknown Regions, with no hyperspace lane recorded on our charts.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_PREATTACK_SPEECH_03,Thankfully one of our scholars has noticed that the Star Map planets have a direct link to the system. It is clear what must be done, the Star Forge must fall.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_SURVIVED_SPEECH_01,Admiral Dodonna:  Our Fleet was not enough to break through the Sith Armada and destroy the Star Forge. With it still operational the Republic is in grave danger.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_REP_SURVIVED_SPEECH_02,Jedi Master Vandar:  Fortunately we still have a completed chart to the Star Forge, and as long as we still control the Star Map planets, we can attack again.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_DELAY_HINT,Take Star Map planets from the enemy to prevent them from launching another attack on the Star Forge.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_DESTROYED_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Sith Lord:  The Mandalorian animals have done the impossible and destroyed the Star Forge. This is a dire blow, to be sure, but the Sith have endured worse.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_DESTROYED_MANDO_SPEECH_02,Your carelessness has cost us our trump card, and may well cost us the galaxy. Unfortunately, we have no choice but to continue to rely on you, so you will survive your failure... For now...
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_DESTROYED_REP_SPEECH_01,Sith Lord:  Curse the Republic and curse the Jedi! Their ceaseless meddling has unraveled our great design once again.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_DESTROYED_REP_SPEECH_02,Without the Star Forge, we will have to defeat them with only what remains of our mundane resources and the power of the Dark Side.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_MAIN_HEADER,Story - Safeguard the Star Forge
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_MAIN_HINT,If either the Republic or Mandalorians take the required number of star map planets, they will immediately launch an attack. Even if neither enemy ever claims enough star maps, one will attack the Star Forge at a random time after you have conquered half of the planets on the map.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_MAIN_SPEECH_01,Sith Lord:  The heart of the Sith Empire is the Star Forge, a Dark Side-fueled factory of seemingly limitless capacity left behind by the fallen Rakatan Infinite Empire. Its location deep in the Unknown Regions is kept secret from our enemies. As long as it remains so, the Star Forge can continue to furnish us with enough materiel to conquer this galaxy.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_MAIN_SPEECH_02,Revan first discovered the Star Forge by combining fragments of ancient star maps scattered across worlds throughout the galaxy. If these map fragments were to fall into the hands of our enemies, they will surely follow Revan's trail back to us.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_MAIN_SPEECH_03,We know that rumors of the Star Forge are spreading despite our best efforts to preserve its secrecy. Our foes will surely find it eventually, even without the aid of the star maps. When – not if – they do, we must be prepared to fend off an all-out attack.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_PREATTACK_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Sith Lord:  I did not think the Mandalorian savages had enough intellect to decode the information from the star map fragments and find the location of the Star Forge.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_PREATTACK_MANDO_SPEECH_02,We need to recall our forces and defend against the Mandalorian Fleet. The survival of the Star Forge and Sith Empire depends on the outcome.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_PREATTACK_OBJECTIVE,Ships that you gather to %s will hyperjump to the Star Forge and defend it when the enemy arrives.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_PREATTACK_REP_SPEECH_01,Sith Lord:  Our worst fears have been realised, the Republic has collected enough star map fragments to piece together the location of the Star Forge.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_PREATTACK_REP_SPEECH_02,We need to recall our forces and defend against the Republic Fleet. The survival of the Star Forge and Sith Empire depends on the outcome.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_SURVIVED_MANDO_SPEECH_01,Sith Lord:  Good, very good. You have utterly vanquished the Mandalorian attack. Those savages who survived to flee must be too frightened to do more than cower in a dark hole.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_SURVIVED_MANDO_SPEECH_02,See that you keep hold of the star maps; if you do, the vermin shall not return to trouble the Star Forge again.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_SURVIVED_REP_SPEECH_01,Sith Lord:  Ah, to feel the deaths of Jedi ripple through the Force... Intoxicating. Fools that they are, the Republic may make another vain assault on the Star Forge if we don't take the star maps out of their hands.
TEXT_STORY_STAR_FORGE_SEARCH_SITH_SURVIVED_REP_SPEECH_02,Further attempts would be futile, certainly, but nonetheless, we have more important matters to attend to than swatting flies away from the Star Forge. See that you reclaim those star maps.

A young and capable fighter who was in search of fame, he led Vipsanis' assault on the lost world of Endelaan against its valiant defenders. His honorbound nature led to some friction between him and his superior over the atrocities Akero committed under their orders.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_ALEK,Born on Quelli, Alek's home was a victim of the Mandalorian Crusades, forcing him to flee to the Republic. Alek would be tested for Force sensitivity and sent to the Jedi on Dantooine, where he became friends with fellow Padawan Revan. When the Mandalorians attacked the Republic, Alek was moved by the suffering of its citizens into joining with Revan against them. But despite many victories Alek found his morals compromised with each one, feeling himself slide further into the dark side. He would come to believe the galaxy needed strong leadership in order to protect it, and abandoned his past identity; as Malak, he would become that leader.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_ARMYTROOPER,A piecemeal collection of planetary militias and mercenaries, the Republic Armies are multifacted organizations with complicated hierarchies where each general reports directly to the Defence Ministry, and brigades and companies may be at equal command levels within an army. It's only the reforms of Revan that began to weld the disparate entities into a whole instead a patchwork subordinate to the better organized Navy. Nevertheless, the Republic equipped their troops well to allow them success against all target types.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_MARK_I_ASSAULT_DROID,Designed by Czerka Arms originally for garrison duties under the Republic, the Mark I Assault Droid was put to greater use by the Sith. Initially used to fill out holes in military recruitment during the early Jedi Civil War, they would become more common as boarding repellants for Sith vessels as the war continued. It could use its unipod to advance position before squatting down into a short, sleek profile to fire at the enemy while being difficult to target back.

This kept on until the Mandalorians invaded the Republic, where Dyre met with the Jedi fugitive Zayne Carrick, who helped fake his death.

A contemporary of Ulic Qel-Droma, Master Shim firmly believed that all Jedi at some point step along the path of the dark side of the Force, and cautioned that the concepts of redemption and atonement cannot help control a journey on the dark path. Jedi who hurt innocents under the sway of the dark side Shim believed could not be redeemed, but only atone for their actions. To that end Shim acknowledged that all Jedi must not ignore the shadows and the routes that lead to them, while also not blinding themselves to the light and taking responsibility for their own powers.
